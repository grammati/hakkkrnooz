# hakkkrnooz

Alternative interface to Hacker News.

Live at [http://hakkkrnooz.herokuapp.com](http://hakkkrnooz.herokuapp.com)

I made this so that I could read Hacker News comments:
a) Breadth-first, if I choose, rather than depth-first.
b) Using the keyboard.

Navigate stories and comments with the arrow keys (or h-j-k-l, if you roll that way).
Comments are a tree that expands out to the right.
Press enter on story to open it in a new tab.
That's about all there is to it. Enjoy.

## TODO

* Make columns scroll individually, so that the active comment is lined up with its parent.
* Handle too-fast keying - double-right, etc.
* Handle timeouts when scraping HN.
* Stop the header from overlapping comments.
* Add "About" - basic help.
* Handle mouse clicks.
* Show age, domain, link usernames to profiles.
* Show user images?
* Set cache-control headers - take advantage of varnish on heroku.
* Keep track of read/unread. Use localStorage.
* Configurable - allow some per-user configuration?
* Use show already-read comments - collapsed, dimmed?
* Allow posting of comments?
* Live updates - insert new comments as they arrive.
* Bug: horizontal scrollbar on some comment blocks
* Keep data on the server - historical points, rankings, ...
* Show trend for stories - page-position over time, points over time, ...
* Mobile - touch-friendly version?
