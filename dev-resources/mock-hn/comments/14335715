                  <span class="c00">&gt; Women who behave like their male colleagues may be disliked for being “pushy” or “bitchy”, but these penalties are offset by the fact that they are also likely to enjoy more power and greater financial rewards. When men adopt the jobs and behaviours associated with women, however, they typically experience a loss of status with fewer perks and more social sanctions, especially from other men.<p>I think older (straight) men do not care about loss of status or social sanctions from other men.  They care about loss of status from women.  Especially when in long term relationships, there&#x27;s the fear of an incorrect narrative where their partner often <i>says</i> that adopting feminine roles is appreciated, but subconsciously leads to less attraction.  (with acknowledgement that the reverse is sometimes true for women&#x27;s perceptions in the eyes of men)<p>[edit: it&#x27;s actually in the article too ~3&#x2F;4 of the way down, I should have been more patient]<span>

                  <span class="c00">I&#x27;m always iffy about articles like this because so much of the ground has been utterly salted by online &quot;men&#x27;s rights&quot; activists that are more motivated by misogyny and antifeminism than actually righting wrongs.<p>It seems like a good read, but I would loved more data to crunch.  The numerics of working long hours was a great example of how the mathematics of the situation make this stuff happen.<p>Anyhow, my wife and I actually do the fully-equal thing - she makes a bit more than me (teaching in Ontario is paid well and I&#x27;m not working in one of the Big Tech Market cities) so we have get to split things 50&#x2F;50.<p>This actually presented a great opportunity: She wanted to go back to work early from her parental leave after the birth of our 3rd kid.  So I did something new: I took the other half of the leave.  7 months off with my kids.<p>If you have the opportunity, do this.  It actually made <i>more</i> money for us, in terms of strict income.  Both of our employers provided a several weeks of top-up parental leave in which the government unemployment-insurance benefit is supplemented up to your full weekly paycheck.  So by both of us taking time off, we got to double-dip on this.<p>And the experience with the kids was fantastic.  I got to play boardgames with my son and teach him to ride his bike, and took my two daughters jogging in a double-stroller every other day.  I practically <i>lived</i> in a ring-sling, even getting the stink-eye from greasy guys on a family trip to Manhattan. I got to properly get to know the parents of all my son&#x27;s best friends and we&#x27;re all still close.  I was in the best shape of my life and had a great time, and my wife likes her job so she was happy to be at work.<p>I&#x27;d considered doing it on our 2nd kid, but friends and family had talked me out of it because of worries about my career.  I don&#x27;t even <i>work</i> in the same place I did when my 2nd was born.  I quit that job later on anyways, so I missed out on that time for nothing.<p>To me, the biggest tragedy is the every-upwards climb of working hours for the household.  There was a time when a family would live on a single 40 hour workweek.  And what have we gained?  I mean, for people who work retail, does the fact that they work on Sundays and every night to 10PM mean they actually sell more goods?  Or does it just mean that retailers need to pay staff less per-hour because they&#x27;re selling for more hours?<span>

Marriage seems to make men more productive at work because it allows them to outsource much of the housekeeping to their wives.&lt;&lt;<p>I don&#x27;t see how that last sentence makes any sense. Since when does one&#x27;s earnings have anything to do with whether the housekeeping for one child or three children is &quot;outsourced&quot; to wives? I think it&#x27;s far more likely that being a father to more children is correlated with being older and more experienced and therefore more highly compensated.<span>

But oftentimes both partners have different assumptions about what is fair contribution and how much free time is fair, don&#x27;t talk about it really and resentments later on ensures. Like both of them believing they do too much simultaneously.<p>Other times one of them (can be also a women) takes advantage of the situation and the other one does not have much choice subsequently or figures it out only after a while maybe when it is too late. (If women hates her job, it is easier for her to claim that kids need mom longer&#x2F;more to stay out of workforce longer which puts more pressure and stress on husband. If stereotypical geek claims that it is just not possible not to stay late, he can avoid some of boring housework. )<p>In other cases, the choice is made by tradition and peer&#x2F;family pressure which prescribe proper roles (like in case of deeply conservative catholics I know - roles are strict and given by god end of discussion).<span>

It seems to be a truism of therapy that &quot;you should never be ashamed of your feelings,&quot; but the very real benefits that white men continue to reap on one level tend to preclude an emotionally honest reckoning on another level.<p>A lot of the negative effects documented in this essay seem to purely relate to cognitive dissonance. For example, the essay said that men would be more willing to accept certain &quot;child-friendly policies&quot; if they believe that it would not decrease their socially-perceived masculinity.<p>I can only believe that it would also help men to openly express these fears, to state out loud the dissonance in their self conception that (largely positive) social change has wrought.<span>

                  <span class="c00">The privilege they are talking about is not some kind of explicit handout. It is a cultural background. It manifests as other people&#x27;s exceptions, preconceptions, and even things like word choice and shared conceptual familiarities.<p>For instance, if you&#x27;ve ever seriously considered starting a business, then you&#x27;re probably privileged. Because for someone like me, it is simply <i>not a consideration</i>. I don&#x27;t know anyone who <i>cares</i> about business, let alone owns one. Never had any friends who know anything about business. I have no business vocabulary, and I have <i>desire</i> to acquire one. My concept of self-worth is more anti-business than it is business-driven. So I&#x27;m never going to start a business.<p>Does this mean I&#x27;ve not finished school? No. Didn&#x27;t go to business school though. Does this mean I&#x27;m not hard-working? No. Don&#x27;t work hard to make money though. Etc.<p>Now if my father had been a businessman, or If I&#x27;d grown up in a place where people cared about business, I might know a thing or two about how to do it. That background of experience is the privilege they are talking about.<p>I am privileged in that I understand machines, art, language, and education. Those privileges have directly and indirectly resulted in almost every success I&#x27;ve ever had. I am a white professional man.<p>Now you know one. And you probably know many others, if you&#x27;d come at this discussion from a position of understanding rather than from a position of defiance.<p>&gt;What would feminists know about a non-feminist man&#x27;s perspective on marriage and fatherhood?<p>What would someone who doesn&#x27;t even seem to understand the concept of cultural privilege have to add to a discussion about cultural privilege?<span>
