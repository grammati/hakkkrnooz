<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; OP mentions “wondering, playing, amusing yourself with your imagination.” Hell, build something.<p>Mathematics is like AI. As soon as a company/whoever builds upon one of the advances in the field and people en masse start using a practical result that comes out of it, it stops being called mathematics/AI. When we hear the word "mathematician" we almost right away imagine an absent-minded professor not contributing anything immediately useful to the real world.<p>People are basically arguing about language, not realizing that they are pawns of a subtle phenomenon that the name of a discipline taught in school refers not so much to knowledge based on and derived from that discipline in the world at large, but to the actual act of teaching that discipline to children and young adults, and sometimes to performing academic-model-funded (meaning charity-like funded) research.<p>It's a bit sad because this trick the language plays on us probably devalues in the eyes of young people something that is actually a useful/practical skill. Kids may say to themselves, "Why do I need this? I don't want to be a schoolteacher," and they will be both right and wrong at the same time, not realizing how many high-paying jobs from engineering to banks to Wall Street require the mental skill they chose not to spend time developing.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3828433&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3829259 href="vote?for=3829259&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3829259></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=InclinedPlane">InclinedPlane</a> 15 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3829259">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>When I went to college I had so many credits to start due to AP courses/exams I had taken in HS that I started effectively in mid-sophomore year. I didn't know what I wanted to major in or do for a career but I was quite good at math and I enjoyed it so I did that, and ended up with a Bachelor's with a mathematics major before I could drink alcohol legally. Later I discovered my passion for the software craft and went down that road.<p>Do I use any of the math I learned even in high school today? Almost never. And certainly a lot of the math I learned in college I have not used at all since then.<p>That said, I would still do the same thing again if I had the choice. The mental tools I acquired through having an extensive education in mathematics have served me immensely well in my career and elsewhere. So much of math is about following or evaluating the conclusions to assumptions, which is the very foundation of science and of computer science as well, but also critically important in engineering, craftsmanship, and especially in troubleshooting. So much of software development comes down to research, investigation, logic, and the scientific method, and the skills I built up in studying math have given me a very sharp edge in that regard even over folks who have CS degrees from quite good schools.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3829259&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3828446 href="vote?for=3828446&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3828446></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=timwiseman">timwiseman</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3828446">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a fervent math addict whose enjoyment reaches into my choice of programming language (functional) and who would be delighted to be gifted a text on differential forms, I think this question deserves to be asked.<p>Math teaching is being carried along with a thousand year momentum and while the current curriculum made sense when many jobs involved building catapults, bridges, ships or cathedrals and jobs as a carpenter or mason were more numerous, they make little sense now.<p>Notice also that most of these subjects were set at a time before education was necessary so that if you went into say a gymnasium; odds were you wanted to be a teacher, academic or engineer. So topics like trigonometry, geometry, calculus and higher algebra (matrices, analytic geometry) made sense.<p>But these days, the vast majority of people do not need these subjects. On top of that there is a great crime. The most pertinent topics to modern living are given short thrift. Subjects like understanding basic statistics (including mean, mode, median, stdev, and variance), probability (including expected value), basic decision theory and estimation. All of these would have far more use to every day life and could be fully taught in the context of how they would help in real life (media, gamblers fallacy, money management etc).<p>Advanced topics would be things like distinguishing conditional and joint probabilities,  counting (combinatorics), graphs and networks, exponentiation and logarithms, common plots (logistic, exponential, parabolic), rate of change, and the relationship between a circle and triangle (must be taught with animations). These things actually still have use to many people.<p>There is also the question of should math be taught at early years at all? A 12 year old can probably compress their previous 7 year math eduaction to 1. Maybe just numbers, (Z,+) or (Z,*)? I don't know but I think the question of if math education starts too early deserves to be looked at.  The current hatred is in part due to a cycle of teachers who hated the subject having to force learn it in college and then having to teach it by force in addition to other subjects they may be stronger in.<p>Instead let the child's curiosity guide them. So they would arrive not by force and a bunch of unmotivated subjects but by curiosity. To augment the lack of math classes there will be game classes to teach reasoning. Not just video games but also card, dice and board games - with the caveat that the game must be PSPACE complete. Just let the kids play and compete. Maybe they will learn the same type of reasoning that will be useful to learning about chains, posets, groups, first order logic or probability. The more determined may even go read about the topics.<p>For video games the game must allow scripting. I think such a policy would just about eliminate thoughts of the pointlessnsess of math.<p>Kids are not dumb, they will do impressive things if it interests them. Adults make this mistake of underestimating kids all the time e.g. whenever they say things like "whaoh that was done by a 12 year old?!"</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3828765&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3828441 href="vote?for=3828441&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3828441></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gxs">gxs</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3828441">link</a></span></div><br>

I don't use the actual math I learned, but 4 years of solving really hard math problems at Cal honed my problem solving skills and helped me develop a type of stamina to try my hand at them for long periods of time.<p>My grades weren't the best, and having math Olympiads in your classes sometimes makes things harder than they should be. That said, I treasure the experience. I learned to push myself in a way I hadn't before. I learned the value of being rigorous, and even the value of getting creative to solve problems. I learned that even after 4 hours of staring at a problem, I should keep at it because I may get that ah-ha moment at the fifth or sixth hour.<p>So do I use math everyday? Not really.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The analogy between band and math is problematic. Band has various payoffs that math doesn't: getting attention from peers, the inherent joy in playing music, peer bonding via football games, band trips and whatnot. (Not that math doesn't have "inherent joy" -- it just seems more solitary, more cerebral, and less socially glorified than music.)<p>There's no doubt that our math education destroys curiousity, and if we could teach math in a non-utilitarian way, as a sort of artistic endeavor, that would be amazing, but... is it even possible?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Music can be exactly as solitary and cerebral as math. That aspect of music doesn't get the same press, is all. If you play three chords on a tall stage people know you're in a band; if you sit in your home working out a Bach fugue nobody needs to know.<p>I have a slightly silly book about birdwatching. It has a section which talks about birding competitions - "Big Days", they call them - and the final two sentences stick in my head, always:<p><i>Don't go away from this thinking that birding is an endless succession of fabbydoo games or fun, fun, fun without a moment's rest. Quite the opposite. Birding is mostly about looking at birds. It is no use to pretend otherwise.</i><p>A useful motto.<p>Birding is very popular, of course, even in the go-go all-action United States. Other popular activities include knitting, gardening, hiking, sudoku, crosswords, reading, fantasy football, Angry Birds, writing comments on message boards, and, ahem, hacking. All of them solitary, cerebral, and socially unglorified. (Though I guess fantasy football is arguable: You can probably spend an entire evening over beer talking with your friends about the performance of their fantasy football teams. For all I know it's even popular in high school. I knew several people in high school who were reliable authorities on every active major-league baseball player...)<p>People have a warped view of other people's lives in general, and particularly the lives of high school students. I suspect that high school kids enjoy quiet, solitary activities as much as anyone else: In other words, more than you notice. The quiet hobbies are just unobtrusive, so they don't get a lot of press and they don't show up in movies or TV except around the edges.<p>Speaking for myself, I think I stayed <i>away</i> from band in school because it was full of people and attention. I gravitated <i>toward</i> the quiet sources of pleasure and meaning. Of course, I was blessed with a math club mentor who knew what "recreational mathematics" was...</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3828929&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831168 href="vote?for=3831168&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831168></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nickpinkston">nickpinkston</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3831168">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I really like to put it this way: "Of the several professional mathematicians I have known, only one of them could calculate a 15% tip in her head."<p>Now, mind you, all of them know that, in order to get the right overall tip, every person can just calculate the tip on what they themselves ordered and pay that -- and it will magically sum to the right value. They might also know that if you had to tip self-consistently -- that is, if you also had to pay a 15% tip on your tip, and a 15% tip on your tip on your tip, and so on, that this process converges and is essentially the same as just paying an effective tip. (They might even be able to tell you that the effective tip is 15%/0.85, if they're still reasonably young.)<p>Those are the sorts of things they're good at. I know some who will talk your ears off about the convergence of an involution series in a noncommutative algebra and the problems of just finding a nice notation which makes the problem not look ugly, because the idea is really just so simple once you skip past the messy derivation to the intuitive result.<p>Computing the actual tip? Not so much. Heck, that effective tip? That's 3/17ths, if you really churn the mental gears! Who has time to divide 3 by 17?! That's what I have a calculator for. Except, well, I didn't bring a calculator because we never use them -- but that's what the computer in my office is for.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3829254&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3830043 href="vote?for=3830043&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3830043></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vacri">vacri</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3830043">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I really don't understand your point. Calculating a 15% tip is monstrously simple to do in your head. When I visited the US, I was able to do it from the first meal onward, for meals solo or alone.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I mean "when presented with a bill, how much to tip." It's just not the sort of thing which mathematicians are ever expected to do. There is no math journal where you can publish the tips you calculated. It's not their job, there are no theorems to be proven there, etc., etc.<p>(You're actually doing it a little more complicated than it has to be because it sounds like you're spending a little memory remembering the number you took 10% of. Take half, add it to the original, which is presumably still right in front of you, then drop the digit after.)<p>I learned a lot of mental calculation because my background is in applied physics, where you're expected to reason about the size of things etc. (A good example question might be, "how far do you think an air molecule can go before it bumps into another air molecule?")<p>So, just for example, to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit you multiply by 2, subtract 10%, and add 32. It is exact. So 25°C → 50 → 45 → 77°F. To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius you subtract 32, divide by 2, add 10%, then add 1% if you really feel like it; it is approximate. So 52°F → 20 → 10 → 11 → 11.11°C. Those sorts of things I will do in my head when people give me a number in one or the other temperature. Tipping is especially nice when compared to the fact that in New York State there is an 8% sales tax which is not added to any of the prices on stuff at the store -- calculate a tip and halve it.<p>[Naive reasonings on air: small upper bounds can be given by the fact that it has to travel easily through the small passageways in your inner ear, but my favorite calculation is to take (kinematic viscosity) / (speed of sound), both of which are things that an applied physics geek should roughly know.]</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3830465&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3828395 href="vote?for=3828395&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3828395></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=flom">flom</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3828395">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with the analogy between music and math is the free-will aspect. Everyone is FORCED to take math, whereas most people are NOT forced to play an instrument (at least in the US). Everyone knew a couple of math wizzes who usually were not the one's asking "why do I need to learn this?" These kids would probably do math even if they weren't forced to, and indeed, many of them go on to pursue a higher education in mathematics, completely voluntarily. On the other hand, many kids whose parents force them to play an instrument often complain and ask "why do I need to play an instrument?"<p>tl;dr: If you force someone to do something, and you don't want to make them resent the thing you're forcing them to do, you should explain to them why you're forcing them to do it, i.e., why it's in their best interest, whether it's math, music, learning a language, etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3828395&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%32%37%38%38%31">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=mv8Yn19eV4" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table><br><br>
