<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The author clearly has not spent much time using Word lately, and reading this I was constantly struck by the blatant inaccuracies throughout this piece. Some of his biggest complaints just don't align with modern versions of the software he is criticizing:<p>1) He start's with a rant about Clippy, which hasn't shipped for multiple releases.<p>2) He complains about the XML markup when you want to publish something to the Web through copy-paste. Has the author ever saved a Word document prior to publishing before? There are a variety of choices when saving a file, including the options to save as Plain Text (which removes all formatting), or even as <i>a web page.</i> No idea if the save as web page feature works well for complex documents, but to overlook this when complaining about publishing a Word doc as a web page demonstrates woeful ignorance of the product being criticized. This is especially ridiculous considering he highlights 3rd party programs that convert .docx into .txt. Why not mention that Word does this out of the box?<p>3) "The fundamental unit of Word is the single, proprietary file, anchored to one computer. Microsoft showed users how it feels about sharing work when it switched its default format from .doc to .docx in Office 2007, locking old and new Word customers out of each other's files." As far as I can tell, the author pulled this one out of his ass. The 2nd Google search result for ".docx" returns a link to a compatibility pack released by MSFT allowing earlier versions of Word to open .docx files. The 3rd result is the Wikipedia page for "Office Open XML," which is the standards-based format that all Office documents are saved in. (The 1st result is a free online 3rd party .docx to .doc conversion service.)<p>And these were just the things that immediately jumped out at me....<p>There are plenty of valid criticisms of Word and ways in which the software can be improved (apparently feature discovery...), but by not understanding how to use even the most basic features such as "Save to Plain Text," I have difficulty putting much stock in this individuals personal gripes.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for MSFT, but not within the Office division. The above is my own personal opinion, etc., etc.)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3831364&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831731 href="vote?for=3831731&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831731></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kzrdude">kzrdude</a> 34 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=3831731">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Word is not a program for editing text. If you want to edit text and only text, there are a hundred different tools that allow you to do that much more efficiently. Then you have Markdown et al. for formatting your text.<p>What word actually is, for most people who don't need its advanced features, is an amateur desktop publishing tool. Word is for making fliers that you stick to the light pole. Word is for printing out notices that you stick to the coffee maker. Word is for writing pretty invitations for your 7 year old's birthday party. The same is true of virtually every "word processor" out there, including LibreOffice Writer. The switch from text editor to desktop publishing tool took place right around the time they started displaying page outlines in wonderful WYSIWYG. You don't need WYSIWYG if all you care about is the content, right?<p>But everyone has an inner artist, even though only a few are actually any good. It's amazing how much people (including myself) care about how their text appears on a piece of paper or a WYSIWYG editor. Sometimes, this distracts from the content. But as long as the content isn't being completely neglected, I think we should forgive people for wanting to control the font in which their writings appear, or for wanting their quotes to look "smart", or for spending 20 minutes tweaking the line spacing of their resume. It's human nature to mix a sense of aesthetics with everything. Word caters to that desire. In this respect, a PDF file is only marginally better from the point of view of the unfortunate recipient, and sometimes even worse.<p>So the problem isn't Word, it's people who abuse Word while performing tasks to which it is not best suited. For example, when you're sending a story to an editor, it's obvious that the editor only cares about the ASCII content and not your choice of fonts and margins.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3830965&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831029 href="vote?for=3831029&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831029></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wvenable">wvenable</a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3831029">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>True. But Word has a much larger installed base than any of the real desktop publishing tools you mentioned, or any proper web page editing tool. Every new PC nowadays includes Starter editions of Word and Excel. Word also happens to be capable of doing some of the things that these more specialized tools do, albeit rather badly. Meanwhile, people don't like to learn new tools. So it should come as no surprise that everyone just uses Word for everything. The result? Wrong tool for the job.<p>But I'm not sure if I agree with OP's idea that Word is becoming obsolete. Maybe it's not very useful for technically oriented people, but we still have a long way to go before printing becomes obsolete, if it ever does. Even Google Docs shows page outlines by default, as if the document were meant to be printed on Letter-sized paper. Which means the best that we can hope for, for the foreseeable future, is that people will use the right tool for the job.

It's quite the opposite, actually - most of the people I interact with don't give a crap about how the text looks, as long as the content is right. Sometimes it applies even to people earning money on publishing, like Internet journalists. I can spot spelling, punctiation and spacing mistakes immediately, almost subconsciously, after looking at the text and because of that I tend to annoy many people by insisting that no, a text full of typos, misplaced spaces and without much formatting is NOT of an acceptable quality.<p>Why people completely don't care about aesthetics is beyond me.

In the latest version of Word, if you have files stored at a shared location you can collaborate by both editing the file directly like in Google Docs. Second, the Track Changes feature is awesome.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Is it really a huge surprise that something as complicated as Word formatting doesn't come out clean when converted?"<p>No, but it's a huge surprise to users that copying and pasting from Word into a completely different program (say, a rich text editor in a web browser) brings all that crap along. Unless it's pasting into another Word window, it should paste the plain text. There is absolutely no situation where pasting Word's pseudo-HTML into a non-Microsoft program is the right thing to do. As you mention, Word's formatting is hideously complex, so why even bother? It isn't going to work. Just paste the text.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3831004&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831247 href="vote?for=3831247&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831247></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Elepsis">Elepsis</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3831247">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Second, the Track Changes feature is awesome."<p>I'd say that the track changes feature has a core of awesome that is made ugly by a really bad UX.<p>The worst case is making a bunch of fine-grained changes to a page -- say, a collaborator with poor grammar.  Each change shows up with its own fat bubble explaining who made the change and when.  You do, as claimed in TFA, end up looking like an anal-retentive a-hole (e.g., switching commas inside quotes 10 times per page results in 10 fat bubbles explaining each change).  I simply don't do fine-grained edits with Track Changes on, because I can't bear to see order of 50 change bubbles per page.<p>Another problem with the track changes UX is iterated changes.  You make a change, and then a change to that change (e.g., reword twice).  Each one produces a bubble.  Eventually you can't tell what the hell is going on.  The owner of the document can choose to accept the changes piecemeal, which could result in chaos.  You spend more effort trying to engineer a minimal set of changes than thinking about the content of the change.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3831128&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831227 href="vote?for=3831227&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831227></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tylermenezes">tylermenezes</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3831227">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The thing is, for a lot of non-technical people, it IS easier, just because they know how to use it.  My friend was asked to make a website with CMS capabilities for his church.  They were putting up Drupal or Joomla or something like that, demoing all the features, saying "isn't this so cool and great?"<p>The church committee stared at them blankly and asked, "Can we have something simple like write something up in MS Word?"  Even with WYSIWYG features, they didn't get it at all, but they did get MS Word.  My friend tried to protest saying, "But actually, you don't want MS Word.  This is so much better for technical reasons, and you can format text exactly the same, blahblahblah."<p>The fear that non-technical people have to try to use a brand new system they've never seen before is not something with which I'd ever be able to empathize.  But I am able to sympathize, especially after the day I tried to teach my dad how to use gmail to attach photos (using gmail's drag and drop feature no less!).  It was so frustrating to see he didn't get drag and drop, but he finally did manage to click some buttons, after a LOT of hesitation.<p>Non-technical users don't care that Word adds on all that garbage.  They don't even notice.  They do care that their experience is that Word just works.  And they're afraid of changing.<p>I know that none of this really matters.  More and more people seem to be getting more technically savvy every day.  New technologies will leave old technologies behind, whether late adopters like it or not.  Heck, even my dad can use gmail now.  But part of me feels mean and guilty for making these non-technical people suffer through the transition.  Not that I have any solution for that issue.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3831264&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3831292 href="vote?for=3831292&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3831292></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tylermenezes">tylermenezes</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3831292">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's something in here that says to me that if you just wrapped the tool's (wordpress, drupal, joomla, whathaveyou) admin page in a theme that made it look like a Microsoft Office app, people would warm up to it more.  It's amazing the effort that people will put into figuring out how to do something (effectively half-assed, but still be reasonably successful) with Access, and end up doing it wrong, purely because it looks like the rest of the Office apps they know, when they could put just as much effort into another, more proper tool.  And it's inexplicable how people will put the time into learning to use something that doesn't doesn't look like an Office app at all, like an Access database or some Word Basic application that runs inside of Word (where the buttons are all misaligned and the colors are inconsistent and the screens are just massive grids of buttons), purely because it's spawned from inside an Office app.<p>However, making anything look like a Microsoft Office app is offensive to anyone who actually knows how to use these tools.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3831356&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3830870 href="vote?for=3830870&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%38%33%30%34%38%33"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3830870></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 7 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3830870">link</a></span></div><br>
