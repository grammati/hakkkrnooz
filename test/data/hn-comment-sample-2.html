<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">When I was in high school (late 90s), they had kind of a weird curriculum for teaching programming.  We had AP classes for Computer Science A/AB, which you had to be at least a sophomore to take.  There was also a class called 'Computer Programming' that anyone could take, which I did as a freshman, although the students in the class were actually pretty evenly distributed between all four grades.<p>Basically we were taught QBASIC and given assignments.  The first few weeks seemed pretty mundane as the OP describes, getting into conditionals and loops, etc, but after we learned those, my teacher told us to make something like 'Choose Your Own Adventure' text-based game.  I remember loving that assignment and even compiling it as an EXE and sending it to my other friends.  This pretty much followed through the whole year, learning some new programming concept (arrays, functions, etc) and then making some sort of game as an assignment.  We had the usual "write a program to display all the factors of a number" assignments too, but I just remember loving the game projects.  I didn't know anything about Big-O or AVL trees or whatever, just that I could create cool stuff on a computer.</p><p>In 10th grade I took Computer Science A, and about half the class hadn't taken Computer Programming already.  The material was a lot drier, obviously, and I remember a lot of those students switched out.  I witnessed the same thing my freshman year of college --  no 'Choose Your Own Adventure Games' as an assignments, just grueling midterms on polymorphism and inheritance.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">So this post really resonated with me, because my thoughts have basically echoed this for awhile -- why isn't software engineering taught as a discipline that can let you implement and create, since that's exactly what it is?</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662214&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662599" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662599&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662599"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thecabinet">thecabinet</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662599">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; So this post really resonated with me, because my thoughts have basically echoed this for awhile -- why isn't software engineering taught as a discipline that can let you implement and create, since that's exactly what it is?<p>Because most colleges teach "computer science" not "software engineering".  Computer science is primarily about abstract concepts, and not so much about necessarily doing anything worthwhile with them.  (This is similar to saying, "Why doesn't physics teach me to build X?"  Because that's mechanical engineering!)  Admittedly, there's hopefully some occasion to apply the concepts, rather than just memorize them, but the focus should be on the science, not the engineering.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">In my curriculum, software engineering was one of my possible senior classes (including OSes, compilers, etc., almost all focused on application).</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662599&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662869" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662869&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662869"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vyrotek">vyrotek</a> 51 minutes ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662869">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This pretty much mirrors my experience in college.  From 98-00 I took Computer Science (and did well) but eventually switched to MIS.  Why?  Because I spent two years making terminal-based C++ apps and became so frustrated at not being able to make real-world programs that I just gave up.  It was so frustrating to be watching the first web bubble develop and yet be in class learning and writing something that seemed so completely different.</font><p><font color="#000000">I don't know if it was my fault or their fault for not being able to bridge the gap between theory/learning and practical skills.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">As someone who learned to program in my 30s (spent my 20s as a professional musician) I can't agree more.  The book that was recommended to me was K&amp;R, which I found so dry as to be impossible to read through.  The first book I really used was C++ in 21 Days, which has you writing working programs from...well, from day 1.<p>I always thought the reason for this problem in teaching programming is that what you need to know when switching to a new language is totally different from what you need to know when you don't know how to program.  If you already know how to program, the first thing you need to know is the syntax: data types, iterators, etc.  It's like being a carpenter and going to a new shop -- what are the tools?  But if you don't know how to use the tools, being told the torque on an impact wrench is completely useless information.  Not only is it useless, it's easy to look up, and therefore a waste of time to teach.</p><p>I now help teach the Boston Python Workshop, a weekend workshop for non-developer women and their friends.  We do cover loops and data types on Saturday morning, but then all afternoon is projects -- building programs that cheat at scrabble, access twitter, and draw colored grids.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I totally understand why experienced programmers teach the way they do -- it's what they'd want to know.  But the focus should not be on the language, it should be on the skill of how to program regardless of language.  And yes, that's really hard to teach.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662960&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662544" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662544&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662544"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=edtechdev">edtechdev</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662544">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This is stuff educational researchers have known for over 20 years, and theorists have known for 100 years (John Dewey).  It's called situated cognition.  Learning happens in context.  You have to give students a <i>reason</i> to learn, not just learn something for its own sake.  It explains why for example a Brazilian street kid may be a whiz at math, and a 6 year old may have hundreds of Pokemons memorized.  See for example the work by James Paul Gee or Jean Lave.  John Dewey said 100 years ago that we shouldn't educate just to prepare kids for a future they know and care little about, we should educate them for today, teach them stuff that is useful and interesting to them today.<p>An example of my own - at 9 my father attempted teaching me programming with basic - I thought it was pretty boring all that work just to draw a US flag on the screen, especially compared to the videogames I was playing.  I was similarly bored with a basic programming class in high school and a survey of programming languages (lisp, C++) class in college (worst class I ever took in my life, actually).</p><p>It wasn't until early college when I started making CGI web applications, games, and educational software that I learned real programming and saw the value of it (along with the value of similarly boring calculus/linear algebra stuff).</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I disagree with the author of this article's put down of GameMaker and similar tools.  Python was not designed for beginners, and neither was Javascript, of course.  Right now Scratch may be the best tool for teaching kids how to program, although it is very limited and not so great for creating games as other tools.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662544&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662634" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662634&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662634"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FuzzyDunlop">FuzzyDunlop</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662634">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This post very eloquently expresses what I've believed for a  long time as well.<p>It really hurts me to see newbie programmers in first year classes going through Java, writing getter and setter methods for a monster Object Oriented cash register or something. The code is spread across 40 different functions in 10 files, each function containing at most 5 or so lines of code. I'm sure it is a nice starter code for an amazing cash register application that can potentially scale to thousands of lines of code correctly, but it is not the way to teach programming. What a disaster.</p><p>I've made my own set of tutorials in the past on programming (see the set at <a href="http://karpathy.ca/phyces/tutorial4.php" rel="nofollow">http://karpathy.ca/phyces/tutorial4.php</a>, though this set is for intermediate students who are already familiar with coding). I've always felt that coding should be taught in context of doing something concrete, not just by itself. Snippets of code without the whole don't mean anything. I also take a somewhat extreme view in that I think that game programming specifically is the best way to teach, because making games is engaging and students learn all the programming only as a by-product. Once they are comfortable with the basics, they should be introduced to progressively larger code bases, and at some point it becomes obvious why Object Oriented paradigms, for example, are a good idea.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">As a last point, I think Udacity recognizes this as well and shares a similar philosophy. Notice their first two classes: "How to build a Search Engine" and "How to build a Self-driving car", not "101: Computer Programming", with Chapters 1. Variables, 2. Control flow, etc.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662348&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662403" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662403&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662403"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ilovecomputers">ilovecomputers</a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662403">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I have two kids. The time at the computer is deliberately limited, so they aren't into games that much, although they like the online games, etc. Not into programming either, they didn't even pose a question 'how is this program made?'. To them it's more like a whole self contained thing. Like a car. You don't sit in a car and say 'I don't like the curve of this seat, I'll hack this afternoon and see if I can come up with something better'. I hope you get an idea. What they do like about computers, is that they can use them to create something - drawing, presentation, writing. In fact, both are really into writing - trying to write novels and short stories. So computer to them is like a tool, which you can use to create something, but not modify itself.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662418&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662729" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662729&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662729"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=muyuu">muyuu</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662729">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I'm not a kid, but I'm late enough to the game to be considered a youngin'. My first computer was a 160mhz Win98 box.<p>I started programming in '99, when I was invited to a programming class by my typing teacher. His first year long class were split between C++ and Visual Basic. Don't cringe yet! The first semester was all C++ to learn what it is to program in a strict language. The second semester was VB because, now that we did the hard stuff, he "wanted us to have fun with programming." That's when we made all those cheesy games, like tic-tac-toe and connect four. If we wanted to continue next year, it was all C++ for the rest of the curriculum. I ended up buying a C++ and Visual Basic compiler just to program at home.</p><p>I believe a group of peers really helps bootstrap the learning process. You want to compete to learn more to create cooler stuff to share and get excited when a friend pulls off something pretty spectacular. Excitement and passion are contagious as all hell.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I was also part of the "I wanna make games!" crowd as well. At the time I was playing Half-Life and Starcraft. I think deep down you know that it will take work to make those kind of games, and so the "Hello World" program doesn't seem so bad because you are only learning. I also think games precondition you to learn the basics since most start out with a tutorial and a gentle learning curve that build on things you learned before. In a way, programming is one long protracted game. I would be curious to see if being a gamer today correlates with getting into programming more often, even if you don't end up making games.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662321&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662292" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662292&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662292"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johncoltrane">johncoltrane</a> 7 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662292">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I agree that involving beginners with OOP is a distraction -- albeit a very important principle. But they must be able to write their own modules, functions and classes first then be comfortable with exporting those <i>then</i> OOP can come naturally from that. Most software is still highly procedural in nature (while it may consume and refer to objects) and even in languages like Python where everything is an object you can still write software that has a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. Once you have a handle on all that, you can then start utilising the objects and their properties and that is huge fun in Python and Ruby.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=3662548&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37">reply</a></u></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_3662619" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=3662619&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%36%36%31%39%34%37"><img src="./hn-comment-sample-2_files/grayarrow.gif" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="2"></a><span id="down_3662619"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tycho">Tycho</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662619">link</a></span></div><br>
