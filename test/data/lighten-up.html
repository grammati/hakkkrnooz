<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>As the woman, I've been the only person in the group asked to put together a pot luck (presumably, this work is beneath the males). I've been the only one asked to take notes in a meeting... even if I'm the one who's presenting (because my title really should be 'secretary who we let on the servers').</i><p>This, more than the jokes and comments, is the meat of the problem. Inappropriate jokes can be much more easily addressed as soon as they happen - if you're in a meeting and your boss asks you to 'please pull up your blouse because your wonderful breasts are distracting everyone' you can much more easily address it right then and there.<p>But if your boss asks you to take notes, the first couple of times it happens, it could just as well be random (though it isn't, really). It is much harder to say 'no, not taking notes, you only want me to do that because I'm a woman' even when it's true. What's worse is that even when you do notice a pattern, it's harder to address than a rude remark. It's (a) hard to prove it was because of your sex as opposed to some other aspect of your personality ('maybe he thinks you're just good at organizing potlucks, sheesh' - 'you took notes that first time so well!') and (b) behavior is much harder to correct when you have to point out things that happened in the past. 'I take notes 50% of the time, in a group of 5' just doesn't seem to have the same effect on humans, especially in a society where intent is often judged above effect.<p>I'm not a woman, but this is what it seems to me, from what I've observed.<p>edit: I can't find the study I was looking for, but they had a group of people evaluate two sets of identical resumes, with female and male names, for 'competence' and 'likeability'. For males, competence was correlated with likeability, but for females it was anticorrelated, even though the resumes were identical. Less people will think you an 'ice queen' if you call out an inappropriate remark, but countering the above form of sexism seems far more difficult to do while preserving 'likeability' -- 'what's the big deal, I just asked her to take notes!' If anyone else knows where the study is, I would be grateful.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736942&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737011 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737011&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=ea131c50d72e0c413c84ffa7e14fd690be039bf1&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737011></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mechanical_fish">mechanical_fish</a> 22 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737011">link</a></span></div><br>

That's further propagating the problem.<p>...<p>&#62; You see, you are still treating her differently, where ultimately, no one treats her differently.<p>Actually, everyone is treating her differently. The problem isn't just that people see men and women differently. That's almost impossible to change in the short term. In the short term, all you can do is try to get people to treat each other fairly.<p>I've no opinion on whether or not "Black History Month" is a good idea or not. Maybe it's a piss-poor token effort. Maybe Freeman doesn't care, because people treat <i>him</i> fairly, as he's outrageously successful, but other African Americans <i>don't</i> get treated fairly unless people make a big deal about doing so (which they usually do, thanks to a huge amount of anti-black-discrimination sentiment ... Latinos aren't so lucky). I'm not an American. I don't even know what "Black History Month" is.<p>There's three things that should happen - everyone should try to treat everyone else fairly, people should stick up for groups of people who are treated unfairly (whether they are a member of that group or not), and people should try not to think of people as belonging to any particular group. But when a group is treated unfairly, if you don't think of them as a group (on occasion), you can't stick up for them.<p>What I'm saying is that your shouldn't primarily consider someone to be defined by their (race / gender / height / whatever), but should occasionally stop to think about whether people might be getting treated unfairly, and do something about it if they are.<p>I'd consider saying "maybe I should take notes, because it's not fair that the girl always seems to do it, and (name) is busy with her presentation right now".</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3741078&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3741386 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3741386&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=d0b793148a4bf5501d6118244b53fa2185bd1ae6&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3741386></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=not-a-pc-whore"><font color=#3c963c>not-a-pc-whore</font></a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=3741386">link</a></span></div><br>

People here being called "african-american", "asian-american", "japanese-american", "indian-american" (different from the "Indians" who are the original (native) Americans) and so on. This shows the inherent racist bigotry prevalent and the sense of entitlement felt by the WASPy americans. Why not call all Americans (whether by birth or naturalized) as Americans instead of differentiating?  On the same lines, I'd suggest calling white americans from Europe as "white caucasian americans", "italian-americans", "irish-americans", "british-americans" etc. Oh, and one more, China != Asia.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for the story. This is why, though my approach has been gently and justly accused of being "passive" downthread, the passivity is the key in this case.<p>Don't overtly "defend" Amy. (Or Chuck, or any teamaker of any gender, for that matter.) Don't use the word "sexism", don't start doing math on how often each team member has been asked to make tea in the last two years, and don't otherwise call attention to your noble sacrifice (which, as you've seen, in an otherwise-mostly-male crowd serves to throw an uncomfortable spotlight on Amy). Say as little as possible. Just make tea. Try to win the initiative: If you start the job first, it can pre-empt argument over who is going to do it. Or if you lose the initiative, but Amy has interrupted her typing to start making the tea, say something like "hey, if you'd like to keep writing I'll make the tea today". (If she says no, don't press.)<p>If you inadvertently attract too much attention, you can make a joke about how much you enjoy tea. Quote some Hitchhiker's Guide or something. It's amazing how useful random whimsy can be.<p>Now, of course if you're always missing from the start of every key meeting because you're making tea the folks in the meeting <i>may</i> be liable to demote you in their minds. This is a sad but true fact of politics: Act like the doormat, and you'll become the doormat. There is a reason why badly-gelled teams tend to try and assign lousy jobs to the person with the weakest political position. So this might not be your final move in this game. But you may be in a better strategic position than Amy to negotiate the necessary change (which could be: rotating the tea-making role through the team, getting catered tea, moving an electric kettle into the corner of the conference room, or just "forgetting" to make the tea and seeing what happens: Maybe the team will settle on one of the above alternatives, or maybe it'll turn out that tea just isn't important enough after all to be worth the risk of introducing hierarchy into an otherwise egalitarian team.)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739789&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739942 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739942&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=055ec502ddc3e4f36481994d323a0fb9feeb4ffb&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739942></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ErrantX">ErrantX</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739942">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've been thinking about this, and to be honest that <i>could</i> equally be seen as sexist, and also backfire.<p>Things like <i>But you may be in a better strategic position than Amy to negotiate the necessary change</i> could certainly be considered sexist if voiced. What you are suggesting is much the same as what I did do - simply missing out the overt portion.<p>It has advantages; it probably saves people being put in awkward positions, on the spot. But it could take longer, and backfire on you personally. And theoretically (I suppose) it could solidify ones own even-more-subtle sexism.<p>This is why I struggle with situations of equality in general. I think the whole issue is a minefield where you are damned if you do, and damned if you don't. And any thought process will end up offending someone.<p>Ultimately the key is to do whatever you do for the <i>right reasons</i>. The wrong reasons are probably "because she cant stand up for herself" and the right reason is probably "because that doesn't seem right". With empathy and common sense applied in spades.<p>As you say; this is a lot easier to address in a cohesive environment. By my observation - if people are playing office politics the sexism is probably just one part of an overall game.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739942&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739188 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739188&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=3147ff650029b4f0c2cf7b170fc233f4bc26d13e&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739188></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DanBC">DanBC</a> 9 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739188">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's some research showing that people associate "bullying" with childhood.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>We discussed it in depth after, because we are close friends (which helped).<p>It wasn't so much exposing her as being offended; she was put out by the treatment, but had gotten used to it over time. To the extent it didn't bother her any more (the more I tell this anecdote, the more awful it seems really!). When I raised it as an issue, publicly, it brought all of that back.<p>In addition it made her feel that everyone saw her as being targeted, and unable to cope with it (partly because we were so close, she imagined they saw her getting me to stand up for her where she could not). Whereas before she could think of it as a private upset between her and "Chris".<p>I never even thought of it in that context; "Chris" was doing something inappropriate, I felt that calling him on it would be a good way to resolve it for everyone.<p>What I missed is that it could affect "Amy" in unexpected ways. A private conversation with "Chris" would probably have been better...<p>So, yes, she blamed me. And herself. But only really in the heat of the moment - after the fact she was grateful, just wished I'd done it another way.<p>One thing she did say was that her initial reaction was that I was just as bad (sexist) because it looked like I saw her as unable to stand up for herself (which wasn't what my thought process was, I should add!).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for the followup!  Very informative.  Unfortunately, it only leads to more questions, as you seem to clearly understand (Clearly understanding your confusion seems an odd thing to say).<p>Luckily, you were close friends.  This makes things much easier.  This lends weight to my worry about sticking up for other people when they show no signs of bother.  <i>Should</i> I have been offended for Amy?  I don't know her.  As you pointed out, if I did, that would be just as sexist.<p>Let's be clear here, I'd probably feel uncomfortable <i>for</i> the person being denigrated in such a manner.  But what is my responsibility?<p>I mention this because all to often people are quick to say "Hey, I'd jump in to defend a person," and while well meaning, it's just not that easy.  Even women can't agree on this (not that they should).  On one hand, Amy was perfectly content and these things didn't bother her.  On the other hand, in some manner of speaking, they are still wrong. The move Shallow Hal comes to mind here (to some extent, as ignorance isn't the key part here).<p>This leads me to my way of thinking.  Unless it's out right obvious and offends <i>me</i>, I'm not going to rush to the defense of someone because I think they <i>should</i> be offended.  However, I will support people who do come out and clearly state they are offended, and support them.  If they accept the treatment (for example, always taking notes at the meeting) without a word, who am I to treat them like a defenseless child incapable of defending themselves.<p>Supporting the person after they've made it clear they aren't happy with the mistreatment, on the other hand, I think is fair and proper.<p>Some people might feel awkward raising an alarm that something bothers them.

2.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So if this tea thing happened at (nearly) every meeting, you'd have been able to discuss the issue in private, between meetings, and offer to raise it next time--or probably better, discuss it, let her know that if she'd bring it up you'd have her back?<p>I don't know actually--apparently she had an idea of something she would be comfortable with to address it? I have some ideas for different approaches which I wrote down but then deleted because in the end it comes down to what <i>she</i> feels comfortable with. &#60;-- this is actually not a male/female thing, but applicable in any social situation where you intend to stand up for someone getting the shitty end of a stick.<p>Anyway my point is, I'd almost always first discuss this with the person in question rather than speaking up in the heat of the moment. It's usually not appropriate, puts the person in a tight spot or a spot light and sometimes these things are better resolved at a different, quieter moment anyway. The exception to this (for me) would be when a remark is really offensive or not subtle at all (like the low-cut blouse remark in the article[1]), simply because at that point it offends <i>me</i> as well, even if the person isn't even around because I shall not tolerate such toxic remarks in a place where I have to work.<p>[1] "Hey Jim, your fly is open!

My guess is that most women accept this sexism as a part of life and have a way to handle it, but evey once in a while it just crushes them.<p>The healthiest and most productive solution is to "give them the tools" to feel better about themselves and ignore the sexists of the world, by letting them see that there are good people out there who will treat them with respect and appreciate not only their efforts and accomplishments, but also their sacrifice and struggle.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well, I guess I ought to weigh in on this one, since I am the interviewee in question. First, the story.<p>During the interview, I was interrupted while answering a question with, "I think I have a tick." My brain immediately thinks, "He's on eBay and has just won a copy of The Tick." But then he swivels the monitor around to show me a flesh-colored rectangle with a round, red area in the middle of it. I'm pretty sure that while we were talking, he stuck the camera into the back of his trousers and took the picture, as I recall seeing a flash and him fiddling with connecting the camera. However, it was my first interview in a long time, and I was very nervous about returning to paid employment after 6 years as a stay-at-home-mom.<p>What did I do? I gave him instructions for how to remove it. After all, I am a mom.<p>So... I've been "in technology" for a long time. In middle school, I picked the locks to let myself into the computer lab. In high school, I was the only female student in CS (also trigonometry and pre-calc). In college, I was the only female ever in the computer lab. I studied audio engineering -- which is a great deal less friendly to women (or was) than IT. I have dealt with a lot of weird situations that would not have occurred if I were male. On the plus side, I've never had to wait in line for the toilet.<p>This is my opinion: shit is going to happen and you have to roll with it. Given your life experience and temperament, this may be challenging for you. But if you want something bad enough, you'll find a way to get it, no matter how much shit you have to step in on the way.<p>My observations: men harass each other with equal or greater tendency than their female peers. Myself, I have said things to my male co-workers that have caused them to make the "that was inappropriate" flinch. Also, we can't squelch biology, no matter how smart we are -- if there are boobs in view, his lizard brain is going to notice them.<p>My hypothesis: men are socialized to shrug it off or suck it up, and may even become desensitized to it after a while. Women are socialized differently. To be frank, I don't completely "get women," even though I am one. Two events in my life have forced me to interact with large and varied groups of women, first being motherhood and second being roller derby training. I somehow managed to offend some of these women, and I'm never quite sure how I do it. But once it happens... they pretty much avoid me like I'm diseased. Anyone, male or female, who reacts to something unsavory in this way is simply going to have a harder time getting by in business. Or anything else, for that matter. Curiously, women seem to be much, much better than men at ignoring their lizard brain. Might be nature, might be nurture, but it is a definite advantage.<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone has told me to lighten up (or, in the case of my mom, Erliechda!), I'd be driving a Veyron around my private island. And sometimes it does weigh pretty heavily on me that, no matter how hard I bust my ass, there is always going to be some person who wants to write me off for attributes I cannot control. But that's where you learn who your friends are, right? There is a long list of people in my life who have plenty of respect for me, ask me for advice on stuff and things, and treat me like a regular human being. I prefer to be thankful for those people than let the rest drag me down.<p>Katie, you get nothing but empathy from me for how you feel, despite how critical this post may sound. I have a son and a daughter. The world does treat them differently. Nobody has ever "taken me aside" to tell me I am "going to have trouble" with my son when he gets older. It's flat out offensive to have a teacher deride my baby girl for being outspoken and spunky. It is painful to see what criticism does to her self-esteem. When someone IWASJUSTs you, they are being twice rude. So this is what I told both my kids, "If you had a $20, would you give it to $BULLY_NAME?"<p>"No," they responded.<p>Well, if you wouldn't give someone a $20, then don't give them the power to hurt your feelings.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3740767&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3740813 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3740813&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=bc41adc240bc8e6b1d3d826ea76dd5fe1d624182&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3740813></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3740813">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>job interviews in which she was shown pictures of her interviewer's bare ass;</i><p>Holly horror story!<p>Sadly I am not surprised to hear this, because I've heard many similar stories. And yet out of the very large number of male friends in the industry I have, including myself, none of us have ever or would ever do anything like that. The paradox here is answered by the fact that a tiny share of creeps will always be found in any sufficiently large set of humans. And the larger the set, the bigger the number of creeps.<p>Thus I think the only way to guarantee this kind of thing becomes part of the past is to radically increase the share of women in the industry.<p>Now, that doesn't prevent creeps from being creepy, but it does guarantee that the small number that they must be, can never be creepy to a large number of women.<p>This is kind of depressing as it basically assumes we can never completely get rid of creeps.

I... I'm at loss of words. I was trained during my teenage years, that it's <i>cool</i> to say things like that. As I'm getting older, I see how sexist and demeaning this is. But it's really hard to break this habit, and this "Hey, it's just meaningless joke, right?!" line of thought.  I try, I really try, but sometimes I forget myself.<p>On a similar note - I have exact same problem with how I perceive woman and man having multiple sexual partners. 
"Good key opens many locks, but good lock is opened by only one key" and all that bullshit - I <i>know</i> that it's ridiculous to hold woman and men to different standard in this regard, and I mostly learned to don't do that, but my... <i>instinct</i> that was ingrained in me by society tells me otherwise.<p>I find myself struggling to suppress my subconscious mind in this regard, and frankly, I don't know how I can help it.<p>Edit for clarity: I don't have problem with such posts being written and upvoted, quite opposite actually, I'm glad they are written and read.

Is it sexist and demeaning to find her sexually attractive?<p>I'm not disagreeing that the statement is offensive and inappropriate, but I'm not sure it's <i>sexist</i>.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736912&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737134 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737134&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=9cdc0b335037e6ae442192a70dd597246859cfd6&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737134></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ajross">ajross</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737134">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is always where geeks run off the rails in discussions like this.  We want to come up with rules for things: either this statement is "sexist" or it is not, and here is the objective reason for that decision.<p>But it misses the point.  Context matters.  In a utopian environment where women felt equally respected, sure, a sideways/slightly-inappropriate comment would be fine.  In some workplaces today that might even be true.  But it's not the norm, and in the real world people feel disrespected by this kind of treatment. Not everyone (but some, sure, as I'm sure someone will point out needlessly) likes the fact that their perfectly "normal" clothing choice can make them "attractive" in one context but the butt of a joke in another.  Men, on the whole, don't deal with that.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737134&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738097 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738097&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=e0a789505c77ba76cb6cd3536ab370fa4a42752e&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738097></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=chunkybacon">chunkybacon</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738097">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There can be a lot of hang overs in languages that aim to demean and diminish people. Calling a black man "boy", or a woman "girl" is a way to belittle them.<p>"Boy" vs "Girl" is an interesting one. It's not uncommon, as you pointed out, to call adult women "girl". However you rarely in the straight male world do people refer to adult men as "boy". However in the gay male world, sometimes "boy" is used (e.g. this collection of gay short films 'Boys on Film': <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boys-Film-Hard-Love-DVD/dp/B001L5JMQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1332419006&#38;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boys-Film-Hard-Love-DVD/dp/B001L5JMQ...</a> ). This shows that "boy" (and hence "girl") is a slightly sexualised way to talk about someone. Should you be using sexualised terms in a professional environment? No, so say "women".<p>(BTW: Just because your google search found some results that back up what you say, but might be a bit misogynistic doesn't mean google is right. "Jew Watch" still shows up above the fold if I search for "Jew", but it would be wrong of me to excuse anti-Semitism based on that reasoning)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739388&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3741332 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3741332&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=78e933b5c590079bfdf3beed661c7bcd63744dfc&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3741332></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=chunkybacon">chunkybacon</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=3741332">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If you're calling any female co-workers "girls" in conversations at or about the workplace, you're doing it wrong.<p>There is a long history of society downplaying women's contributions in the workforce by using cutesy terms like "girls", and some of the definitions you've cited here reflect that. But just because a term like "career girl" was once in wide use doesn't mean that it's still appropriate today.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; Why do women wear low-cut dresses if not to attract male attention (in the majority of cases)?<p>Yes, Virginia, this is sexist. Holy hell, is it sexist.<p>You are characterizing a woman's behavior in terms of how it makes you, as a man, feel. There are many reasons that a human might dress a particular way, but by characterizing it as a gender-based, "she wore that to make me do this" kind of transaction you have incorrectly emphasized a single way. This woman wore it for no other reason than to attract male attention? Really? Are you sure? Her decision is entirely based on how it would make a man feel?<p>I'm a heterosexual man and I wear certain jeans because I like to show off my butt. That's fine. But am I doing it because I want to attract "female attention"? Not exactly. This turns on a subtle point, but it's very important: I wore them for me, not for anyone else. Feeling attractive is not the same as receiving attention. I don't want to be honked at, felt up, leered at, or <i>even commented on</i>. But I do want to look good. Does that make sense?<p>This situation is only exacerbated when you bring in gender dynamics: men and women are equal, yes, but women are the ones who've been oppressed for centuries and are struggling up the slope to reach equality. What a man says to a woman exists within this context, so simply reversing the roles and pointing out that it's okay HERE but not THERE is not sufficient.<p>Check out: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze</a> The section about feminism and the male gaze applies here, too.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737216&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%37%35%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737420 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737420&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=0605809ec298037d71ef486e5253d86e21b900e4&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737420></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ryanwaggoner">ryanwaggoner</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737420">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>Are you sure?</i><p>Of course I'm not <i>sure</i>. But when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras. Why do all the waitresses in Hooters wear low-cut tops? Is it for comfort? Is it because they couldn't afford the other 30% of the shirt? Or is it because that's proven to be very effective at gaining male attention?<p><i>I wore them for me, not for anyone else.</i><p>This makes no sense. In a post-apocolyptic world where you're the only person on earth, would you dress the same way you do now? Would the last woman on earth wear low-cut dresses and mini-skirts? I doubt it. Being "attractive" specifically refers to other peoples' attention and emotions towards you.<p>I'm not saying that it's ok to leer at women, to verbally or physically harass them, etc. But it's incredibly ludicrous to me to think that someone dressed in a manner usually considered "provocative" probably did so without any intention, or that anyone responding to that mode of dress is automatically sexist.<p>Would it be appropriate for a woman to start coming into the office topless? Would it be sexist of me to find that sexually arousing? If so, I guess I'm a sexist.

It makes sense if the person was someone you didn't find attractive at all, but what if you did find that person attractive in normal work dress? Would you seriously not be aroused if they came into work topless? Or do you magically turn off your sense of attraction at work?

And its not just a male response, either (<a href="http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind9710B&#38;L=AEJMC&#38;E=7bit&#38;P=1367351&#38;B=--&#38;T=TEXT%2FPLAIN;%20charset=US-ASCII" rel="nofollow">http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind9710B&#38;L=AEJMC&#38;E...</a>). Nudity sells, and not because naked people look different. It's because our brains are tuned into paying attention to them, both by nature and by nurture.<p>The point of what I'm saying is that anyone wearing things that make you look good will ALSO make those who would otherwise be attracted to you pay more attention. It's not a choice, it is literally hard wired into our brains. Our brains respond chemically (<a href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/98/3/1374.abstract" rel="nofollow">http://jn.physiology.org/content/98/3/1374.abstract</a>) to the pleasant, attractive things that we see. You have to understand that although you wear your jeans for yourself, anyone who is chemically predispositioned to do so will ALSO have their brains respond chemically.<p>This is no excuse for anyone who acts improperly in response to something that they see. We're all fully capable of controlling ourselves. Some of us have more practice in it than others, but society couldn't function if we couldn't control these reactions. The chemical response doesn't go away, though, it's just mitigated by other chemical responses.<p>We can (and most of us do) control our responses, but it doesn't get us anywhere to pretend that it doesn't happen. .</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738563&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738978 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738978&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=219eb5013e69c2dab8d08fb1de54718d84ac99a1&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738978></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mistermann">mistermann</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738978">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sexism is one of those topics that invokes a lot of disingenuous statements. If the article being discussed was about human sexuality, people here would discuss in great detail how evolution has hard wired our brains for certain reactions, behaviors, etc, discuss documentaries they've seen, post links to articles, etc.<p>But if the article being posted is about the sexist treatment of a woman in the workplace, eventually the discussion will get to the absurd point where many of the men essentially claim that these biological sexual impulses literally don't even exist.<p>If treating people differently because of their gender is wrong, does it apply to both positive and negative treatment?  Because judging by the comment count whenever this subject comes up, nothing seems to fire up the HN crowd more than sexual discrimination.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There is also such a thing as dressing well because it is comfortable, or makes one feel better about oneself, without the intention of attracting sexual attention, and the distinction between the two is <i>not</i> pedantic.

A clear statement of sexual interest, which Katie clearly did not wish to receive.<p>The hypothesis we are being asked to entertain is that she probably <i>was</i> wearing the low-cut dress because she wanted to attract male attention, but that this comment was in some other way offensive. That is, she wanted this guy to <i>think</i> that, just not <i>say</i> it. Because women are touchy, or something.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; Why do all the waitresses in Hooters wear low-cut tops?<p>Because they work in an industry that is primarily based on looks. Just like it's "okay" to stare at fashion models, it's "okay" to stare at waitresses at Hooters. Seeing as you don't work at Hooters (I'm guessing, ( ; ) then this doesn't apply here.<p>&#62; In a post-apocolyptic world where you're the only person on earth, would you dress the same way you do now?<p>I'm not sure this hypothetical adds to the conversation. I also wouldn't dress the way I do now if the gender dynamics in Western culture were different. What's your point?<p>&#62; Being "attractive" specifically refers to other peoples' attention and emotions towards you.<p>I would argue that being "attractive" is more a question of self-esteem than perception by others; see any interview with Megan Fox where she admits to not feeling attractive. It's not about how others feel about you, but about how you feel about yourself. How you feel about yourself is, partly, a product of the culture that contextualizes you, but that's more about the cultural aggregate than specific individuals (the hypothetical woman who is commenting about my great butt).<p>&#62; I'm not saying that it's ok to leer at women, to verbally or physically harass them, etc. But it's incredibly ludicrous to me to think that someone dressed in a manner usually considered "provocative" probably did so without any intention, or that anyone responding to that mode of dress is automatically sexist.<p>Totally. I know you're not advocating horrible behavior, but sexism is not a flipped bit; it's a complex spectrum with multiple dimensions that is hard to quantify as "on" or "off". I tend to think that most people (me included) are sexist, and it's not categorically Bad and Evil, just something that I consider in my responses to certain situations and issues. It's okay to be sexist; it's not okay to make unwelcome remarks about a woman's appearance.<p>But you're asking the wrong question here: why is someone wearing a low-cut dress "provocative" at all? Provocative to whom? Why does how I dress <i>necessarily</i> have anything to do with anyone else? Every woman who wants to wear tight clothing <i>wants</i> to be looked at, otherwise they would wear burqas? It's incredibly ludicrous to me that you seem to be putting forth that supposition. It seems to lead to, "I'm sorry she was offended, but if she didn't want to be offended then she <i>should've dressed differently</i>." Which is a form of victim blaming: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming</a><p>As to coming to work topless: no one is questioning whether or not being attracted to women is sexist. Of course not. But commenting about a female colleague's cleavage <i>at work</i> is sexist and demeaning. Be attracted all you want, fine. But don't cross the line.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737553&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737636 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737636&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=fd497fd7b02acdcb36043f1d2c978000b0c6bf8d&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737636></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ryanwaggoner">ryanwaggoner</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737636">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><p><pre><code>  I'm a heterosexual man and I wear certain jeans because I 
  like to show off my butt. That's fine. But am I doing it 
  because I want to attract "female attention"? Not exactly. 
  This turns on a subtle point, but it's very important: I 
  wore them for me, not for anyone else. Feeling attractive 
  is not the same as receiving attention. I don't want to be 
  honked at, felt up, leered at, or even commented on. But I 
  do want to look good. Does that make sense?
</code></pre>
No, it doesn't make any sense. It completely disingenuous and you don't even realize it. The question you need to address is: <i>why</i> do you want your butt to look good? And the answer is: for the women. Because you want to attract 'female attention'. There is no other reason to care about whether your butt looks good. You could wear any decent pair of trousers that does not show off your butt and the only thing that would change is how much attention you would get from women.<p>And as for 'being commented on': the only reason you even know it looks good, is <i>because</i> people have commented on it, in whatever way.<p>Everything we do, <i>everything</i>, is infused with a desire to mate. You can try to deny that, but that doesn't make it go away. That is exactly what leads to the "lighten up" attitude: trying to defend you acting out on your desire to mate. The only way to reduce the influence of that desire is by acknowledging it and actively attempting to diminish its influence.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738811&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739250 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739250&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=c0a18a89e0742dbea835fbb3a8a7a1cbccdbf272&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739250></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=datashaman">datashaman</a> 8 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739250">link</a></span></div><br>

A self confident gut -&#62; he's probably just being sincere -&#62; cure. A not-self-confident guy -&#62; he's trying to get something from her -&#62; looser.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sexism is endemic to the society and to the relationships which generate that comment.<p>So, right. Imagine that you're a woman.

And wear high heels, they make you more attractive -- but don't wear high heels because they might be clumsy if you have to flee from Unwanted Attention.<p>The problem isn't the clothes. The problem is the Unwanted Attention. As a man, your defenses against sexual assault -- at least the ones that you're taught by the culture -- are chiefly, "don't go to jail." That's because that's the only major place you have to worry about Unwanted Attention. There are maybe some Bad Neighborhoods which you're asked to memorize and route around in addition.<p>"I know where I'm sitting!" paints women as the objects of your sexual indulgence, and commits to undressing them with your eyes.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that there is such a thing as dressing inappropriately. Let's further assume that they are doing so for the express purpose of attracting your attention. (In my experience, men are usually deluding themselves about how much women dress to seduce them, but whatever).<p>The question is, how are you going to react to it?<p>Because one person dresses inappropriately, do you <i>have</i> to react to it like a 14-year-old boy? Are you going to comment on it in a way that implies that women are there for your personal entertainment? Are you, by opening your mouth, going to encourage others to get even cruder? And what about all the other women you work with, or will potentially work with (who probably resent the woman who overdoes the cleavage too)?<p>I understand that you feel that it's unrealistic to ban sexuality from the workplace. But it's not prudishness that is called for, but judgment. Consider that your actions take place in an existing context. In 2012, it doesn't take too many comments like that before your workplace or your open source project or whatever turns into a hostile space for women.<p>Now, I've worked on volunteer projects with people who knew each other really well, and things are considerably looser with regards to sexual humor.<p>The point is, you have to create an environment where women have a secure status. In the typical workplace, people barely know each other, and women are just barely holding onto whatever status they've earned. This probably means refraining from the more puerile jokes and observations.<p>P.S. In the interests of full disclosure, I've failed at this sometimes myself. I had a colleague who was a great programmer, but I was distracted by her body. She wore shapeless t-shirts covered in shapeless hoodies most of the time, in part, I'm sure, to hide this. But more's the pity that she basically has to dress in a tent in order to have her colleagues look her in the eye.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737793&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738838 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738838&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=4ffd6eb916833875b5d5b3c0db02dcb558aa3b79&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738838></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=einhverfr">einhverfr</a> 12 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738838">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sexual assault is no joke. But so what if someone gives you "unwanted attention"? We have become a culture of whiners and rationalisers. It would be like me, as a man, going on and on about how unfair it is that I'm expected to hide fear and put the safety of females before my own. Of course, we're well along the way to destroying that tradition. People ignore the myriad of subtle advantages to this "sexist" approach, starting with the fact that in an emergency no thought needs to be exercised - men know reflexively that they are to put themselves between danger and other people. Maybe we can weaken this a bit and use some different criteria like "the best and bravest should protect others". But if we let the more fantatical egalitarians run the show it will end up with unworkable madness like demanding equal representation in self-sacrifice between men and women.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737221&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737476 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737476&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=69b276abb48c817640789f9e153f3f3ad286a952&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737476></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=drostie">drostie</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737476">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well, the "so what" is everything: Unwanted Attention is Unwanted because it embraces some sort of threat or menace or unreasonable expectation or social tension or unease. To say that we should stop giving women this sort of unwanted attention is not whining or rationalizing, nor is it fanatical egalitarianism. It's just demanding a culture where we men know that it's dangerous to control, frightening to objectify, and despicable to rape. The problem is that we accidentally think of these things as "you know, just a thing we do." We just casually say "I totally owned you at TF2" or "he used to be my boss but then I was promoted and I made him my bitch" -- and if you were asked about the slavery and rape metaphors there you just say "Lighten up, I wasn't being literal about it."<p>Power doesn't have to pervade the society, and it's a bit bizarre how it does. Only last year I joined up with an Ultimate club in Delft, after a childhood in the US. I hated sports in the US because it was cutthroat and antisocial. In the Netherlands there is a big difference, "what sport do you play?" is actually, like, an everyday question. You're expected to have one. And I liked Ultimate here, at least, because people were immediately giving me tips on how to throw cleaner, how to run better, how to stop faster, how to jump higher. It isn't about someone being Team Captain and you wondering whether you'll get Picked Last. I don't know where we learned that as children, but it was part of this bizarre Culture of Power.<p>And it's the same Power Culture which Joel Spolsky warns entrepreneurs about: don't try to dictate what your artists do; instead try to facilitate, let them express themselves as artists.<p>Power Culture might have "subtle advantages" as you say. It probably means that we can hire fewer teachers for larger classrooms, because kids are scared that they might be sent to The Principal's Office.  But the social repercussions are pretty amazing. In a couple centuries I wonder whether this sort of culture will seem as foreign to them as owning slaves seems to us.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737476&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737720 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737720&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=6e454b6419b457d6d6cd2d65dcf51422155e2ea0&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737720></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=javascriptlol">javascriptlol</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737720">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If no one in the context of the discussion finds it offensive, I would say it is fine to say it. If the original meaning of a word has become archaic, then I cannot see a rational reason why one cannot say it. If someone becomes offended by usage of the word, then maybe your position should be re-evaluated, but most insults have their history in bigotry, and trying to cleanse yourself that way is not productive. The word "git" comes from the word "beget", insinuating that they are a forgotten offspring: a bastard. Some people would be offended by being called a bastard, because of it's meaning of being born out of wedlock. But I cannot see anyone being offended by being called a git for it's original meaning. The term no longer means what it does, and censuring it as such does not make sense to me. The same might apply to "I owned you", though I don't know the term so well, so I can't really comment.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738901&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739641 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739641&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=689d7a305e95677b7d683dfad1a3690a95b9933a&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739641></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=drostie">drostie</a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739641">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>What is your problem? I don't ever talk about this in that setting. I'm illustrating an idea, and you try to bully me with things I never did. I don't have "macho" baggage. Where did you get this information from? How would you even know if it was true? I'm pointing out that society imposes some limitations on people and that it's pointless to complain over every single little thing. Your admission that these impositions on men are no big deal just serves to illustrate my point: that there's nothing serious going on here. Just first-worlders complaining over every little perceived disadvantage. And yes I would say something if I witnessed someone bullying a coworker as the OP describes.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Depending on your proportions, some necklines might work better for movement or fit. Like, high necklines on a rectangular t-shirt, if you're well-endowed, have a tendency to creep up and get all chokey. Scoop necks do a better job of this.<p>Some people might consider scoop neck to be "low cut" (because the collar bones are visible--something generally not accepted/expected of men) while others might not call something "low cut" til cleavage is visible.<p>Now, a button-up shirt does a nice job of leaving space for your throat so you don't feel like you're choking, but in case you haven't noticed, it can be difficult these days to find button-up shirts for women that have all the buttons. It has become extremely common to manufacture women's blouses without the second button, or rather, with the second button roughly 6 inches below the first one. I suspect this is due to rules in schools and workplaces allowing for the top button to be left unbuttoned. That way, you're following the rule and showing some decolletage. I once went through every button-up blouse I could find at Target. I came away with having found one rack that had shirts with an upper-chest button. (Oh, and if you button all the buttons on one that's missing that upper-chest one, it just gapes open)<p>If the shirt itself is not quite wide enough to accommodate being well-endowed, a lower neckline can allow the fabric to move horizontally to better fit around the girth involved by opening up a bit wider. On the one hand, you could get a bigger size (if that's even available--there are limits), but if you've got a small waist, there's a tailoring problem for you. And if you've got shoulders that are narrow but a chest that isn't, that's a much more difficult tailoring problem.<p>---<p>Re: bar. I'd rather be asked "read any good books lately?" than told "that dress makes your boobs look good." But then I'm someone commenting on Hacker News, so that might be to be expected.<p>---<p>Re: your wife. I suspect there's a standing agreement with her regarding how you interact in terms of expressing your sexuality. I doubt you'd comment to a male coworker on how his trousers make his lower half look, but if you were married to a man, you might to him.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737264&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3740832 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3740832&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=571ca0e0ddd4b845d5f547add966206e81ef07fb&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3740832></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ckpwong">ckpwong</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3740832">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thank you for pointing out the nuances of female tops commonly available today and how they look on different body shapes.<p>With regard to button-up shirts, tailoring is a much bigger problem for women's shirt than men's shirt.  Ready-made men's shirts are measured in collar size in 1/2" increments and sleeve length in 2" increments.  This allow for much better fit, as men's shoulder and chest measurements tend to correlate with these two numbers.<p>For women's shirts, you're at the whim of the mythical "sizes" running usually in increments of 2 from 0 to 14 (larger if you're at the "plus" section).  Each size up is usually scaled up at all measurements: chest, shoulder, waist, collar, shirt length and sleeve length.<p>In other words, even though there's a much wider variety in women's body shapes than in men's, men's shirts' come in much finer increments in terms of sizing.<p>In addition to the problems you've describe, I have a few more gripes regarding button-up shirts:<p>There's the problem of large gaps opening up in between buttons for the well-endowed, thus offering others glimpses of your undergarment (read: bra).  Opting for a larger size would make the shirt too loose ("not fit") at the shoulders.<p>Another common problem with button-up shirts for women is, they tend to run much shorter than men's shirts, as they are intended to be worn not tugged in.  Depending on body shape and the cut of the bottom garment, certain movements (such as raising the entire arm) may expose skin along and possible above the waistline.<p>Unfortunately, button-up shirts are part of the de facto business casual attire.  Depending on the physical environment, adding a vest, cardigan, or jacket for cover-up may not be suitable or desirable.  (Female jackets tend to hang above the hip bones anyway, so they're not offering much help in the regard of protecting skin from being exposed.)<p>In other words, no, I don't want to expose my skin or cleavage in the office, but sometimes it's unavoidable.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3740832&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737666 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737666&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=4858afad6643d8a8bae91f0cef3bf384efed2ea3&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737666></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=georgieporgie">georgieporgie</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737666">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>Why do women wear low-cut dresses if not to attract male attention (in the majority of cases)?</i><p>So, I'm not going to agree or disagree with you, since I don't really know exactly what you're saying.<p>I will say this, though:  there is professional attire for women.

She could read a newspaper. She could tazer somebody. She could fold everybody paper hats. There are pretty much an infinite number of things she <i>could</i> do, and we all know that. So when you focus on some small set of those, you're not just saying "could".<p>When you say, "Oh gosh, if only those women could learn from my youth and just avoid situations where people might be sexist (say, by staying home and making babies)," then you're shifting the burden of action from the culprit to the victim. It's bullshit. Everybody has the right to go to work without having to deal with sexual, sexist crap like this.<p>But suppose she followed your advice and wore only turtlenecks. Golly, then we've eliminated one symptom. But as she remarks in the article, she's just gone from "slut" to "ice queen". What do you recommend she wear to fix that?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've never understood this question. "Why do women wear low-cut dresses if not to attract male attention?"<p>Women wear low cut dresses because they feel good in them, because they feel they look good in them. Showing off your breasts, if you consider them an attractive part of you, is like showing off your face, or arms, or legs. This question is like asking, "Why do women brush their hair, if not to attract male attention?" Feeling good gives you confidence, and that confidence occurs internally, not because a man can give you external validation of sexual appeal. (My cleavage  may turn you on, but it doesn't turn me on, or make me feel sexual just because it's there.)<p>Women rarely get dressed with men in mind, and it's fascinating to me that men think otherwise.<p>And similarly, feeling good about oneself is not equivalent to feeling sexually attractive. And having someone point out my sexuality all day long, when it's not even on my mind, is extremely uncomfortable, invasive, and (for lack of a less cliched term, apologies in advance) objectifying.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738894&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738954 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738954&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=e3787313c2d0edc0b5f5fa1c744fb2565c7552ac&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738954></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=toyg">toyg</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738954">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Actually, women <i>always</i> get dressed with men in mind; it's just that it's so ingrained, they don't really think about it.<p>Their concept of "looking good" is shaped by magazines and tv shows (still much more so that men, on average); and if you look at your average magazine, you'll see oozes of sex emanating from advertising and content. The concept of "looking good" in western society is equivalent to "looking sexy/desiderable to the opposite sex". Why would women's skirts emphasize one's ass otherwise? When in a suit/tailleur (pardon me, I'm not a tailor), it's among the most professional attires a woman can wear, and it's been sexualized to high heaven. Why? Because it makes women feel powerful. And why do they feel powerful? Because they can attract men, and that's what society tells them their power should be.<p>So whoever tells herself that she wants to look good "to feel better" is, unconsciously, accepting sexism in society almost as much as one who'd crack a joke about it; she's just doing at a much deeper level, one which women still refuse to deal with (it would mean dropping the whole "fashion" industry like a hot potato).</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738954&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3740896 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3740896&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=712b7bc3631747305cde0cdb9b58ceb3728cdd08&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3740896></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=elptacek">elptacek</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3740896">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>"Why would women's skirts emphasize one's ass otherwise?"<p>See, that's the problem. You're sexualizing a woman's ass. A woman doesn't automatically consider her ass to be something sexual. Straight men do. An ass is an ass, and the fact that a man finds my ass sexual is not my concern. Nor do I want to be told about it. But I do like how that skirt looks on my ass. For me. My comfort is the focus, not somebody else's hard-on.<p>I clearly don't deny there's sexism ingrained in most aspects of society, but fashion was not the greatest one to cite on your part. Most high fashion is where risks are taken to challenge what "sexy" (heterosexual man's version of sexy) is, and has less to do with being "attractive" and more about being "artistically beautiful." Does this turn you on? <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YPLSyaja5vU/R7Xqwvpw1YI/AAAAAAAAAhg/eS4p2q01C5U/s400/brit+avant+garde.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YPLSyaja5vU/R7Xqwvpw1YI/AAAAAAAAAh...</a><p>And lastly, to say that caring about your appearance for self-confidence's sake is really just latent sexism, and that women are unthinking enough to not know they do everything for men anyway is... well, first silly, second, offensive, and third, incorrect. We really need to get away from men telling women that their behavior is "ingrained."</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3740966&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737698 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737698&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=fc1118f16e359c7e0970beaeed9b3c59221e5e75&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737698></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Czarnian">Czarnian</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737698">link</a></span></div><br>

If a small fire has started in the kitchen, do you wait hoping it will go out on its own because using a fire extinguisher will make a mess?<p>Before I continue, how often have you said a line or phrase to a friend or someone you have had a long term relationship with (without defining that relationship) that could be viewed as "bad" out of context?  I have seen blacks call each other the N word, people call each other homosexuals, all in their comfort zones of understanding that the other person was not saying anything to be offensive.  It is called understanding each other.<p>She rants on about how "guys" think and how the "guys" push roles upon her.  It has nothing to do with roles.  Pot luck?  There is a very good chance that no one wanted that job regardless of gender.  I'm a programmer.  I don't have time to do a pot luck.  It doesn't matter if I am a man or woman, I am going to try to get out of it.  You didn't and you got stuck with it.<p>I have said comments not unlike the one in the article to a woman before.  I didn't do it because I felt beneath her, or that she was weaker, or didn't belong there.  I knew her for a long time, and felt comfortable that she would not be offended, and that she would get a laugh about it.  If she didn't like something I said, she would likely jab me in the gut or tell me to clean up my mouth, and I would oblige.<p>The problem is she never addressed the issue, and instead let it go even though it was eating her up inside to the point where it did serious damage to her career.  Why?  Because she caved in to her own assumptions and did not address it.  The guy could be a complete douche, or he could have believed that he was giving her a compliment (albeit a lame one) about her dress and the effect it had on him.  No one knows from what place his comment came from except for him and she didn't try to find out.<p>True to tell someone to "lighten up" is a remark that disallows someones point of view.  That is horribly wrong.  But it is wrong to force everyone to make assumptions about everyone else without discussing it with them.  If someone steps over the line, it is your responsibility to address it to them. She did not do that.  Instead she went on a blog and lambasted every male coder in the business.  Strange. I find that horribly inappropriate.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738069&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738761 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738761&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=d3779fde96510b1b5d56043b3ae3fe5789f69c96&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738761></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=natep">natep</a> 13 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738761">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with sexuality in the workplace / people's daily lives today is that a lot of the content (commentary, ideas, beliefs, etc.) revolves around objectifying, marginalizing and degrading women—not as individuals, but as women across the board. Now, a lot of sexually empowered women have no problem with discussing sex openly, or being objectified in the bedroom, or even talking about being objectified in the bedroom while at work.<p>However, the difference is that in those cases, it is always the woman's choice to participate in it. Since they are the marginalized demographic in this matter, the choice should be theirs to indicate what is and isn't acceptable commentary, discussion or behavior in the workplace.<p>Today's environment is one where it’s _men_ who overwhelmingly decide, by way of majority-reinforcement, what other people should consider to be acceptable or not.<p>It all comes down to marginalization: we don't marginalize or trivialize people—or their accomplishments—based on the fact that they eat. However, our society does tend to do those things to people based on their gender; specifically, to women based on their gender.<p>Once we eradicate the culture in which that happens, people can express themselves sexually more freely and without hesitation, in the safe and sound knowledge that doing so won't instantly label them in a certain way that would dramatically (in a negative way) impact their professional and/or social lives—or worse.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3741546&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737960 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737960&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=19f6a003981c591e57b32689f900087b6256e495&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737960></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=danilocampos">danilocampos</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737960">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You have to consider the power imbalance due to gender norms. In our culture, men typically pursue women romantically. This is not always the case, but it is the norm. Hence, in a social setting where it is acceptable to pursue someone romantically, a woman complimenting a man's appearance has the implied meaning "I would be receptive to your romantic advances." [1]<p>However, in the same social setting, when a man compliments a woman's appearance, the implied meaning is "I <i>am</i> pursuing you romantically." And this is fine in social settings, otherwise our species would die off.<p>But it's not fine in the work place. You feel that a woman at work giving you such a compliment is "harmless fun" because if it was a normal social situation, you would have the power: it's up to you to pursue. But for many women it is not "harmless fun" because it's similar to the social situation, and they feel romantically pursued, which is not okay at work.<p>[1] Please note I do not consider this a <i>promise</i>, so let's not confuse this with "asking for it." Human communication is subtle, and such implications are how consensual "courtship" happen. Of course, once there is a rejection, whatever implications one <i>thought</i> were there don't matter.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3740037&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739000 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739000&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=b4b3f07aa83bec086dd6994728a5fb75129c92aa&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739000></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=crag">crag</a> 10 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739000">link</a></span></div><br>

You won't immediately be able to catch everything, so just focus on the things that make you hesitate. Those moments when I think "maybe I shouldn't say this", I almost always learn later that I was right. Use at hesitation to do a little analysis of what the effect of your words might be.<p>You can also practice in your head, or in conversation.  When you're on the bus, think about things you said recently, and analyze them. Look for things that might've hurt people.  When you're having conversations with people, think about what you would've said in that situation. Practice the analysis, and practice saying the right things.<p>You'll never be perfect, but you can TOTALLY get to the point where you're mostly not harming people.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A lot of people can't handle jokes. And a lot of people can't handle sexuality and playfulness, or confuse sexual jokes with sexism. Of course, sometimes somebody goes too far. But also sometimes somebody is too sensitive. It's probably better to err on the safe side and not risk offending somebody unless you're already pretty sure it would be okay with them.<p>I'm having flashbacks now to the video on Reddit yesterday where the black female college student went psycho apeshit in class when the professor was lecturing about evolution. She seemed to think there was some kind of persecution going on involving evolution and black people, and became violently angry at both the professor and the other students, interpreting things seemingly 180 degrees opposite, almost hallucination-like, compared to everybody else. Compared to the sane, healthy, objective people. They recorded it on many cellphones too. The point I'm making, in relation to the OA, is that yes there is sexism and sometimes inappropriate things are said. But yes it is also true that sometimes some people are wacked in the mind and/or misinterpret things. And without really knowing the specific person directly or seeing the events directly with our own eyes, we can't really know which it is.<p>I'll just close with the observation that there are probably at least 10's of millions of Americans, if not 100 million plus, that believe the Christian God exists, lightning bolts and all, angry man in the clouds, all the miracles, etc. Some of those folks also work in offices and post on the web. Some program. Some are "scientists" even. So take everything you read with a dose of skepticism.<p>I'm also having flashbacks to all the times I've been asked to take notes in meetings.

Don't act on it, don't let it color your interactions or conclusions about her competence, good or bad.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As an armchair behavorial therapist, I think this is the only attitude that will end up having a positive benefit (the author also does the right thing by speaking up). There is no use in playing victim; when someone does something to you that you don't want, you have to push back.<p>For reasons cultural or otherwise, men have a tendency to attempt to subtly dominate people they perceive as weaker. To some people, this seems almost like an instinct, and it's really fascinating how just subtly pushing back or ignoring it seems to stop people from doing it with you.<p>I don't know a lot about how this manifests itself towards women, but if you are a guy, the best solution is to just push back and perhaps actively study and notice the tricks guys use to achieve social dominance. As a formerly shy guy who was often at the receiving end of this kind of behavior, I think that a lot of these gender problems would even out if <i>all</i> women managed to subtly assert themselves a bit more.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>They may not go anywhere productive in your eyes, which I would imagine means they do not reach a definitive and world-changing conclusion in the course of the thread, but they do increase awareness, particularly in male-dominated arenas like this.  Increasing awareness is probably the most important thing that can be done.  See klausa's post.<p>It's also the case that fighting injustice and increasing awareness of societal boulders that need to be broken down might very well lead to larger change that results in less actual dying in the world.

It also reminds me of discussions I've heard on local African American radio talk shows. There's this constant subtle pressure one feels, and it is the result of knowing one is subject to arbitrary disrespect coming from out of the woodwork. The fact that it's often "plausibly" deniable doesn't make it better.<p>Knowing that you have a target on you does have an effect. That it's fairly uncommon doesn't make it better, if it happens often enough that the possibility is always lurking in the background.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Being an ex-queer (bi ;) I've had to put up with my fair share of subtle jabs and general discomfort with my presence. After a long time I figured out that the only thing that worked for me was to be more dominant than 'them.'<p>The thing is, women (and queers) are fucking powerful, they're just powerful in a different way. Ironically, but not unsurprisingly, women are taught not to use this power as it's 'inappropriate.'<p>You see, men don't have a clue as to how group dynamics work. Women do and have been trained in this from childhood on as it is their 'arena' just as much as the sports field is ours.<p>When we enter the workforce however, suddenly 'fair' means fighting like it happens on the sports field, 'fair' means fighting the boys' fight.<p>In the workplace, open competitiveness and overt displays of hierarchical dominance (boy's game) are perfectly acceptable, but figuring out the motives of your enemy's friends, observing when he breaks them and subtly informing those friends about that in order to weaken his support base (girl's game) is considered 'nasty.'<p>When I finally accepted that this was bullshit, everything turned around for me.<p>Whenever someone did something like this to me, over the next few days several of his allies would get a quick visit from me with some nice small-talk and a little one-liner thrown in about how X hurt me by doing Y. Within days X would find himself somewhat more alienated, perhaps reprimanded slightly by one of his peers about Y, left to wonder what he did wrong.<p>Over time it was as if a subconscious message spread across the workfloor: "You'd better respect me. If you don't your life will become a lot harder and you'll have no idea how the fuck it happened."<p>Now for everyone who reads this and thinks my description of this is disgusting, please understand that I'm merely able to describe it this way as I've had the fairly unique perspective of having been a part of both 'worlds.' From a woman's perspective an in-depth analysis of mens' quest for dominance would sound equally messed up.<p>Just like very few men understand a woman's world, very few women understand a man's world.<p>TL;DR; Men and women establish hierarchies in different ways. Women have been taught their way is inappropriate in business. They should do it anyhow.<p>P.S. Funnily enough, after I started dating a girl and 'became straight,' the women on the floor suddenly started calling me out on this behavior and nudged me back into the 'male hierarchy.'</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736940&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737217 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737217&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=7f0e6f07f5bbe61330ac5c331804f039c0efee5b&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737217></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=astine">astine</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737217">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Not to put too fine a point on it but, forthrightness always makes one vulnerable. I'd say that's part of the reason it's valuable and part of the reason people are sometimes afraid to be so. When you openly (and kindly) share your grievances with someone, you give them a chance to respond, either with understanding or retaliation. It's entirely reasonable to fear retaliation because people often feel attacked as well when accused of something, but if we don't give people the chance to behave rightly, how can we blame them when they behave wrongly? People deserve the chance to be good and if they don't know they've wronged you, they haven't had that chance.<p>Let me give you an example of what I mean. When Charles Dickens originally wrote Oliver Twist he included the character of Fagin, who a stereotypical 'evil Jew.' Many Jewish people were rightly offended and later when Dickens made some Jewish friends they explained to him why they found the character so offensive. Dickens took what they said to heart and removed direct reference to the character's Jewishness in later reprints. Imagine if Dicken's friends, instead of reasoning with him, spread rumors about him and turned the world against him. Instead of making him less of an anti-Semite it would have merely made him more paranoid, and more afraid of Jews than ever.<p>People who are forthright and reasonable gain respect, people who aggressive, either sneakily or openly, gain fear, but not respect. I respect you for being honest here and I hope you continue to be so, but understand that I could not possibly trust someone who behaved in the manner you describe.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3740604&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3740771 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3740771&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=1b6961b508e440f0fc835010134e651b0d77c448&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3740771></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mtrimpe">mtrimpe</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3740771">link</a></span></div><br>

How to make and break alliances? How to inform on their competitors?<p>Open competitiveness and overt dominance won out in our culture because they worked, not because alternatives were unavailable to men. Those traits allow to create stable organizations which went on and conquered the world, often literally. There's nothing stopping men from mastering intrigue, it's just very destructive, much more so than competitiveness and dominance, even fistfights will damage the group less than constant shifting and mind games.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737095&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738103 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738103&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=9b6ed34833455c37190fcea74238f4a9a12cf42b&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738103></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mtrimpe">mtrimpe</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738103">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>To whatever extent the "girl's game" is such, it's largely because for centuries, female social hierarchies consisted of social groups of gossiping housewives and male social hierarchies consisted of business and politics--though the two certainly intersected when the wives of businessmen and politicians talked. (One notable intersection happened during the Andrew Jackson administration and ultimately led to the end of John Calhoun's vice presidency: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_affair" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_affair</a>)<p>Analogously speaking--just because whites held social power over blacks by virtue of better education doesn't somehow mean education itself is an artifact of white supremacy, it means that lack of education is an artifact of oppression. Likewise, having to passive-aggressively gossip in the background isn't some kind of feminine power, it's an artifact of oppression against women preventing them from speaking and acting more openly.

What if you were unemployed for 2 years and then got a new job?<p>And for an entrepreneur? Say for some reason your company isn't doing well. You go and pitch a big account that could be "the big break" (that digs you out of a hole). The decision maker says something offensive. How willing will you be to stand up at that time when you have something <i>big</i> to loose?<p>Of course this is all a matter of degree obviously. Some people will definitely shy away from doing the right thing in almost all cases while others will go to their death defending what they believe. Even if it makes them homeless.<p>I remember being in a situation years ago at a company in Silicon Valley where the head of marketing (who is very well known and respected and teaches now believe me you've heard of him) was very offensive, parental, basically a dick. And of course nobody said anything at the time to challenge him.

I view it more as listening to a professional colleague telling a story from her perspective. I'm not experiencing it as hate, more as hearing from a woman 'this is my perspective'.<p><i>Do you really think the man who said:

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Good questions!<p>Sure, the guy's actions are unprofessional (though I hate the term), and discouraging. I wouldn't say creepy. I really hate the term "creepy" because probably (and yeah, here I'm speculating) the guy has been called a creep his whole life. Probably he's even creepy. But shouldn't we feel sorry for such a person?<p>(United States) society has a really bad habit of locating blame on male citizens and not looking further for causes of their behavior. There are lots of examples of this, but a really blatant one is the current incarceration rate. We like to say "this person acted badly and they suck - I'm sure they have reasons - but they suck!" and stop the conversation there.<p>Like I said, I'm really sad that one of the effects of this big pile of sad men is that women are discouraged. But I'm also sad that they're sad - and that they engage in behaviors which make them more sad. For instance: unhealthy eating patterns, drug/alcohol abuse, gaming addictions, porn addictions, etc. I'm also sad that they're mean to other men - e.g. flamewars. I'm sad about a whole big bucket of things.<p>---<p>You're asking whether I'd classify his actions in a particular way (unprofessional, creepy, discouraging) and, for the most part, I would. The question (as you point out) is where to go from here? What do I do with all this anger?<p>One thing I'd like to do is fight back against the conditions that make the world shit for nerdy teenage boys. I'll take myself as a prototype here, but as a nerdy teenage boy:<p>1. Other teenage boys are mean to you
2. Other teenage girls are mean to you
3. Your teachers more or less hate you for being better than them at the subjects they teach
4. Your parents think of you as a failure because you're not dating/doing normal things
5. Society at large is disgusted with you (media portrays you as a creepy pervert, etc.)<p>I mean, let's keep things in perspective, here. This woman had a shitty run of things, but was she suffering? Really? I (and a lot of people I know) had to put up with 100x more intolerance and aggression on a daily basis from the time I was 10 until I was 18. From both genders. I was bullied. I was laughed at. I was scorned by family and teachers. Sorry if we came out a little malformed.<p>Hell, I'm not even bad at interacting with women, since my skin normalized and I had the luck of working at a big retail store where I had to interact with them a lot. I had girlfriends and such and now I'm married. Shit has more or less fixed itself, but it's not really my fault as such.<p>Yeah, so what to do? Let's create art which actively portrays the sex-starved teenage nerd boy as heroic, in his own way? Let's give him some love, as a society? Let's extol his virtues, maybe once? What support is given to these people, really?<p>The sick thing is that for every such nerdy guy I know who became successful (mostly the smart ones, and mostly as programmers) I know 5 who were pretty much crushed by the stress of all this and have never really recovered.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737542&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737660 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737660&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=2601ce04dd9c8d025ad2e99b92703b8caf037a25&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737660></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=theorique">theorique</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737660">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I hear that. I think it's a positive step to have compassion for both sides in this workplace disagreement. And I sure don't mean to paint low-cut-shirt-comment-guy (LCSCG) as irredeemably evil.<p>The reality is, in the situation under immediate discussion he's in the role of the victimizer and he's crossed the lines in the workplace. Is what he did illegal or even fireable? No to the first, and probably not to the second. Does it mean he should never be allowed to work in his field again? Hardly.<p>But is it reasonable for him to be required have a talk with HR about what's 'OK' and what's 'not OK' when dealing with colleagues? I think so. Gaining a better understanding of the way your communication lands on people is a very important step in maturity and growth. Better he should learn such a thing later, in the workplace, rather than not at all.<p>And you're right - maybe he has a past history that drives him to behave the way he did / does. Perhaps earlier in his life LCSCG was victimized too. Perhaps he has anger or resentment against the popular girls who laughed at him or the football players who dropped his books in the mud and pushed his face in it. I don't know. None of us do.<p>Maybe LCSCG, and others in similar situation, can get some kind of help - coaching or therapy or socialization - that helps him interact with others in a way that's more resourceful. I think that's a result that almost anyone would support.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737660&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737757 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737757&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=fc4d6231f043ef47e1fb34e7af8c764726184a71&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737757></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bmj">bmj</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737757">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that the guy is probably suffering from his own insecurities, but the bottom line is that he allowed his issues to place him in a situation of antagonizing a co-worker, probably without any repercussions, which speaks to a general climate of discrimination against women in the workplace.  Still, some of your other points are interesting and I feel are valid in a larger context.

They are dealing with their emotions poorly. They are not good at dealing with their emotions, especially towards women. But when did they ever say that they were? Did we stop to think whether this is the reason that they went into a profession which (for a long time) was almost 100% male? To not have to deal with women and their emotions towards women?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yeah, I guess I was factually wrong about rates of women/men employment in tech. I'm not sure this is crucial to my original point, though...<p>---<p>Construction workers are basically social outcasts. They have low social and economic status. I am very sad for them and I don't think of them as "brutes" (which term is part of their oppression).<p>Don't get me wrong - I think of capitalism as more or less fundamentally oppressive. Pretty much everyone is being shat on by the system and we need to keep this in mind when we talk about justice and ethics. People are under stress. These problems are not easy to fix.<p>---<p>I'm really not saying that the harassed has to find compassion - I'm saying that we all do.<p>The issue here is that you can treat a single harasser as a problem to be fixed, but when "harassment" becomes a systematic/structural phenomenon you can't think about things in terms of changing individuals anymore. You have to start thinking about policy decisions and social movements. I'm merely saying that when the social movement takes place which tries to fix this problem, I hope it takes into account the idea that the people doing the 'wrong' are not brutes, evil, etc. but mostly sad and awkward.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737601&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738410 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738410&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=f7c64981ab931330516ecee80c65273c50efa481&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738410></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 15 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738410">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It is not that simple to equate a (perceived) need to escape from women to a mental illness. Female groups do behave differently than male groups in that they assert dominance and rank by psychological means whereas in male groups this happens more via physical means. It can be very hard for both women and men to enter a 'different-gender group', let alone to get accepted and feel comfortable. Especially in fields dominated by one gender, like, for example, construction, programming, education and child care, or health care this lead to problems and strengthens the trend of one-gender dominance.<p>In the last decade or two primary education has become a primarily female field even to that extend that male teachers (and teacher students) have chosen to leave the profession because they didn't feel at home in that environment any more. If you talk to them you'll hear stories about, basically, psychological war-fare among their female colleagues that they didn't want to get involved in but were forced into nonetheless. In these instances feeling the need to escape from women is quite natural.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738847&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737262 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737262&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=971ab9e660f5523ae17087967986ae2e9b5f3055&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737262></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mindstab">mindstab</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737262">link</a></span></div><br>

Interacting appropriately with the opposite sex and other ethnicities, etc., is a reasonable expectation of someone who wants to work in a modern workplace (and I don't limit that to the office or technology jobs.)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737417&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737566 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737566&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=415438f91f299ce85435f130caba4235ceef4a93&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737566></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yelsgib">yelsgib</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737566">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>I think of stock brokers/financial workers as particularly miserable people - you can be rich AND miserable! I don't know any construction workers, but it really doesn't seem like a happy job.<p>It's not about excusing behavior, it's about talking about the reasons behind that behavior so that those reasons can be addressed properly. The proper way to address issues whose source is pain and suffering is compassion. Not "feeling sorry for" a person, but understanding that they too are suffering and including that understanding in your analysis of the situation. The point that I find very frustrating in all of this is that the suffering which causes "inexcusable behavior" is not being talked about. We're not talking about -why- men act in this way, except in flippant ways - calling them "manchildren," etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737566&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%79%65%6c%73%67%69%62">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737706 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737706&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=d5dd33f64ee29bd01e409b6b3b3e9ff19998c91d&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737706></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tomkarlo">tomkarlo</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737706">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Having worked in both finance and software, I don't think either group is particularly happier or more miserable than the other. Both jobs have tradeoffs. Neither is truly stressful in comparison to say, being a soldier, EMT or policeman. (I can't speak to construction - but it does have a high injury rate.)<p>We're not talking about grossly inappropriate behavior here. We're really talking about behavior that's sufficiently in the margins that an otherwise "okay guy" might do it because they just don't understand why it's problematic, or they don't realize they're doing it. (As opposed to really blatant sexual harassment or misogyny, which is still common in lots of other industries.) It seems to me that the issue with most of what the OP relates is simply rooted in ignorance and/or insensitivity, rather than any kind of suppressed suffering.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737706&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737041 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737041&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=b3050ad26b0d690f59ff73f8cdbc828a4457722a&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737041></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=InclinedPlane">InclinedPlane</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737041">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I answered this on the blog comment you made too, hopefully it will get readership in both places:<p>This is not a bad question. I would like to make several points here, and hope a woman commenter chimes in with first-hand perspective too.<p>First of all, the "guys joking and jabbing each other" thing is true. But it really isn't that simple of a social interaction. At the early "getting to know each other" stages, the punches are pulled a LOT, and the pairwise bits of acceptable jokes are slowly teased out. Each member of the group must be felt out for OK and Bad joke topics etc. Think about every male bonding comedy (or drama with comic relief) you've ever seen. The new guy is paling around with the group, and suddenly he makes fun of the dog, or the tattoo or someone's mom, suddenly the whole group is quiet and serious, and "oh you just don't go there, never make fun of gary's poodle". There are rules and boundaries to it, even in "everything goes" atmospheres. (exceptions being douche-fests like Jersey Shore... and look how those turn out)<p>Second, there is a lot of difference commonly found between the jokes towards majority "one of the guys" and women or minority "one of the guys". Sure, its funny for a core group member to yet again make a joke about how Isaac can't be trusted because he's a mexican thief, if a new person said that, s/he would be reamed for making that comment -- the trust of "just a joke" is an earned one. Same goes for "katie is just looking for a guy with that top" jokes. And sometimes, they would never ever be allowed, because the person joking is NOT cool with it, and that is OK. <i>addition from original comment: And the only way the jokes are ever ok, is if the target owns that joke as a funny, not hurtful statement. Some people see humor in situations where they are fitting some mockable stereotype, or where they are see themselves in such contrast with the stereotype (and know the mocker also sees this and doesn't buy the stereotype anyway). If the target doesn't see it as humorous, it stops being a bonding jab, and starts being hurtful</i><p>Third, the contents of the jokes should mostly be neutral. I'm pretty sure Katie would be ok if you poked about the time she brought the server down. But, if you follow it with "thats why girls should stay off servers" it changes it, because you would never poke al with "thats why boys should not code". Again, it is the subtlety of bringing the extra factor into play that wouldn't otherwise be noted in "one of the guys" (e.g. gender, race, sexuality etc). <i>I don't know katie, but my workplace jokes follow this pattern</i></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738484&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737537 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737537&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=ae44caf3216d8aa2a69cf3cb957b167e91f87b91&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737537></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=theorique">theorique</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737537">link</a></span></div><br>

Telling a guy to stick to computers because he sucks at talking to girls in a technical industry is like telling a woman to go back to the kitchen when she's a chef.<p>Telling a guy to stick to computers because he sucks at talking to girls when his job is to run and promote a female-targeted wedding convention is a little closer to the mark.<p>As a female, getting told "stick to computers, you suck at flirting" when you're technically-inclined is a lot less offensive than "go back to the kitchen" -- not to mention that the first is a jab related to observation of an individual (presumably there isn't a stereotype that all men suck at talking to women) rather than a jab related to your chromosomes.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I consider the phrase "lighten up" patronizing and would avoid it altogether. I was once told to "lighten up" by an interviewer at a bank and immediately knew that I did not want to work there. It's insulting to suggest that a person ought to have feelings other than the ones they have. In my view, feelings (not behavior) are generally involuntary, largely beyond conscious control and lie outside the moral sphere.<p>I'm in academia, where the use-mention distinction isn't recognized where sexual innuendo is concerned. To be on the safe side, I take the attitude that even non-interacting, space-like separated particles at opposite ends of the universe could be accused of sexually harassing each other--and probably are.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738763&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737208 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737208&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=cd02dcd3733a4a31a661b24628cc039bd8cb1635&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737208></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nikatwork">nikatwork</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737208">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>My non-programmer friends and family are always bewildered when I tell them that I hope my daughter doesn't grow up to be a programmer. The reason why is because I'm afraid her life would be like the OP's. There is indeed a subtle sexism in our industry. That's why things like yesterday's Sqoot screwup happen so frequently.<p>Of course, every workplace is different and I'm sure there are plenty of places where women don't have to deal with the bullshit described in this article. However, they are far from the norm. I can see why the OP would want to leave the industry rather than be the person constantly reporting people to HR and lecturing them about proper behavior.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Dunno. I'm a woman, and I think that blog poster needs to lighten up.<p>I've worked in IT for years - usually as the only woman on the team - and I've never felt degraded or discriminated against for being female.  Maybe slight prejudices in the beginning when the guys think I'm not as good as them, but I enjoy proving them wrong.  There is banter, and sometimes it's not 100% HR approved, but I've never felt that it was mean spirited or intended to put me down.  I've found that by and large, computer engineers are super-nice, funny, and respectful towards women.<p>The comment about the guy noticing her low-cut dress and wanting to sit near her... not entirely appropriate, but is this really bad enough to run to HR and complain?  That said, I wouldn't feel comfortable drawing attention with my clothes, so I would never wear something low-cut. I find that a lightweight cotton dress shirt is more comfortable than a tight, low-cut top anyway.  If someone asked me to arrange a pot-luck or bring them coffee, it would simply not be happening.<p>I'm on the East Coast though.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'd love to wear lightweight cotton dress shirts. Unfortunately, trying to get a pair of 36G breasts into a shirt cut for my size is an exercise in futility. The results border on pornographic - gaping buttons, bulges etc. I have a few choices:<p>a) buy a shirt 3 sizes bigger and look like a clown<p>b) spend a fortune on clothing designed specifically for the 'well endowed' woman OR<p>c) wear something I own that makes me comfortable - which may or may not be low cut but is bugger all to do with anyone else (and really, most of the time is not designed to be low cut but ends up being so because the material shifts)<p>Do any of these situations warrant me being commented on, criticised or jeered at? Should I suffer these comments for something that isn't my fault?<p>(And don't even get me started on how being a breastfeeding mum impacts on both the choices above AND the range and depth of comments I receive.)<p>I'm glad that you've never felt degraded or discriminated against for being female.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I mean "lighten up" as in, she perceives "a million little barbs" around her and sees herself as the victim of sexism lurking everywhere. She didn't just criticize one company or co-worker, but the whole industry.  Her post is a torrent of rhetorical questions, exclamation points, hyperbole, and quotes she ascribes to her co-workers that likely never happened. Do you really think someone responded to her concerns with "if you are not in the middle of being raped or beaten or threatened or fired, lighten up"?<p>To make such sweeping statements about the industry, I presume she was not happy at her job, changed jobs, and the same thing happened again, and again, to the point where she left the industry altogether, discouraged. Which is weird, given that I changed jobs often myself and never had such experiences.<p>Two sentences gave me the most pause. One being, "Which label do I want to be stuck with today?  Ice Queen or Slut?" It makes me think this is more about herself than the people around her.<p>The other weird comment was that she loves coding and "spent thousands of dollars to go to conferences so I can learn more about it." All excellent IT people I know learn stuff hands-on by playing around with technologies and studying on their own. Maybe there are other reasons why she felt stuck doing inferior tasks. If you are crucial to the team's success, nobody treats you like the "secretary who we let on the server" or a personal assistant, regardless of your gender.<p>I hope that the discussion of this topic doesn't make men paranoid about saying anything around women, because the fun and banter is one of the things that makes working in IT so enjoyable.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737718&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738803 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738803&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=923ee04ffa69b562c9d4b96619ccd7cd36f50af0&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738803></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kamaal">kamaal</a> 12 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738803">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This.<p>I work on a small team - just over 20 people - with only four women.<p>Every single one is a hilarious, self-possessed, confident individual. All the men, myself included, treat them with respect... meaning, we tease the shit out of them.<p>To do otherwise would exclude them from the team. Have you ever seen a cohesive group that didn't joke around? A tiny fraction of the jabs traded by men are HR-approved... if we filtered that for the women who work with us, we would be treating them as if they're too weak or too sensitive to be a part of the group.<p>So instead, we treat them no differently than any other team member. If one of the other coders were to arrive unusually dressed up, I would absolutely comment on it, regardless of whether it's a suit or a dress, but one of the ladies would probably beat me to it. Frankly, the women push the HR line harder than any of us guys, and we love them for it.<p>If you find that people are constantly telling you to "lighten up," whether you're male or female, you shouldn't assume that the world is conspiring to put you down.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I like to non-verbally snark, by breaking people's brains.<p>I wear long skirts all the time, and sometimes I cover my hair. So I must be traditionalist/conservative, right? No, I just don't like how jeans are all about objectifying my butt and also never fit right. Some of my coverings keep my hair nicely off the back of my neck in the summer, others let me have pretty flowy fabric (I like textiles). I'm pretty clearly not a booth babe with that skirt though, so maybe I'm a girlfriend? Oh wait, the shirt I'm wearing is from an Ubuntu Developer Summit. Hmm... Wait, but I'm knitting, back to the girlfriend idea, maybe? Oh nevermind, this is too confusing, how about talking instead of trying to guess?<p>I have noticed, btw, that a large portion of female developers knit or crochet.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Honestly speaking I am surprised by the quantity of comments, especially the ones on sexism and similar stuff (how to dress, what to cook, etc). Usually, this is an indicator of one big underlying problem, therefore I assume that it is a problem in the US.<p>At least, this is how the author positions the situation and her individual case.<p>But..... in reality, at least based on what I observed in the multinational companies, where I worked, such behavior usually surfaces in three cases.<p>(1) The person does not understand how organizational dynamics and people/power play works, i.e. does not know the rules of the game.<p>(2) The person is not a good performer, or at least this is how colleagues perceive her or (for god sake) him.<p>(3) The corporate environment and culture OR the boss are negative - in this case most employees are treated like that.<p>Based on my personal experience:-<p>In case of (3) the best advice is to run - find another company that would value this particular individual strengths. There are plenty of companies out there. The life is not worth it to spend it on converting jerks to mother Theresa.<p>In case of (2) the best advice is to "make yourself so good, that they can't ignore you" [I do not recall that exact wording]. I seriously doubt that a valuable employee [i.e. she/he is the only one who can fix things with positive/negative impact on P&#38;L] would be mistreated. In case she would be, than probably this is the case (3) - the company/boss does not understand the employee's value ---&#62; same advice as above - run.   I recall two cases - female HR assistant and male Director of Strategy. The former was just dumb, and the latter was bullshitting his way around. In both cases gender had nothing to do with the fact that both had nothing to bring to the table. So the consensus of high-producing crowd (both female and male) was unanimous.<p>Usually, if a person is an excellent performer, these things (negative comments, stupid microtasks, etc) just do not appear or do not stick.<p>In case of (1) the best advice is to find a mentor (gender not relevant), who could teach or coach on how to behave oneself in a group or organization, so called organizational behavior or simply politics. It is difficult to summarize it, but the goal is to learn how to diffuse negative behavior towards you with humor, words or actions immediately at the point of action in such a way that everybody present would think that the one who initiated negative behavior is a jerk (or dumb, or idiot, or an asshole) without you calling names.<p>For example a comment from colleague<p>&#60;"Oop, Katie's got the low cut dress on today! I know where I'm sitting!"&#62;<p>can be rubuffed with<p>"Oop, John's got his socks smelling today! I know where I shall not be sitting" or smth similar with a big smile.<p>The simple view and approach is to perceive such people as programs with bugs. To resolve the bug you need to understand how the whole piece is working and what's inside. Therefore, you need to understand each individual, what's inside, what are the bugs and how to approach/address them. Each one is unique and shall be dealt with as such.<p>Another approach is to start with yourself - how you perceive yourself and own self-confidence.<p>I agree with OneBytePerGreen that the author shall "lighten up". I do not recall the exact term, but the author perceives that the external environment is what controls her behavior and outcomes. Such view does not faciliate personal growth, or any growth per se. The only way to change is to understand simple fact that behavior of others is defined by your own behavior and start with yourself, because that's the only one a human being can change.<p>On a side note I especially disagree with one of the comments:
&#60;"Oop, Katie's got the low cut dress on today! I know where I'm sitting!"
Anyone says that at my workplace and they will be shown the door in less than 120 seconds.&#62;<p>Acting like that is keeping the real issue under the table and unresolved. The real issue is the person's view of the world and lack of knowledge and understanding of how things work in life. A good boss or co-worker would teach or coach the person how to to deal with that.<p>Apologies for my English and, possibly, tone. My first real post on NH, so I might have missed some 'untold' rules.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739595&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3736915 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3736915&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=0d42facd78a85fbb452e93489e85396486eee513&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3736915></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=paulhauggis">paulhauggis</a> 22 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3736915">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>"Oop, Katie's got the low cut dress on today! I know where I'm sitting!" ... Go to HR and get stuck with his work when they move or can him?</i><p>The thing is, we live in a legal environment where she probably <i>could</i> go to HR and get him moved or fired for saying this. And yet, some men are still sexist jerks to women in the workplace. This suggests that all the blog-posting and HN-comment-hand-wringing in the world won't make a bit of difference.<p>Don't lighten up—accept. When being able to fire a guy for commenting on a woman's dress doesn't even do the job, no amount of complaining will stop the behavior you deplore.<p>N.B. I expect this comment to be unpopular, which underscores my point. We (a) live in an environment where an essay like the OP gets upvoted and elicits sympathy from a bunch of mostly technical guys, (b) where women endure sexist comments from a bunch of mostly technical guys, and (c) a comment noting the contradiction inherent in (a) and (b) gets downvoted by a bunch of mostly technical guys. The problem is basically unfixable, at least by the suggested means; shooting the messenger won't help.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736780&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737292 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737292&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=5915d49f9f8d0a97c9eacd88ea1db79e9fc301bd&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737292></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wpietri">wpietri</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737292">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think you misunderstand. Acceptance is the only rational response when you lack sufficient power to effect change. When crude behavior persists even in the face of a draconian legal environment, complaining about it or writing frustrated blog posts certainly won't fix it.<p>Your situation is slightly different. As a CTO, you have the power to prevent this behavior in your sphere of influence. But fixing the tech industry in general is beyond your reach.<p>You should also be aware that you face the other end of the cannon here. If a woman feels maltreated on your watch, you could be held liable even if you are not culpable. In a small startup, this could be enough to sink the ship. Perversely, this gives you an incentive not to hire women. Indeed, posts such as the OP also provide an incentive not to hire women.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Firing people is clearly an extreme option; it might be worth asking kcunning if she felt that was an appropriate reaction (I'd guess not). Writing a blog post, on the other hand, has generated half a dozen people changing their minds about how much sexism they're prepared to put up with (ranging from "I am confronting my own active sexism and resolving to change it" to "I am more inclined to speak up to challenge active sexism when I see it"). Speaking for myself, it was a series of posts like this that gave me the confidence to start calling other men out when I saw active sexism take place. I suppose you <i>could</i> argue that everyone in this thread who is appearing to change their mind is lying, but that seems to be begging the question--purely on the responses I'd suggest that the preponderance of evidence is that writing blog posts <i>does</i> produce incremental change.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737311&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737377 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737377&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=c3cf62551b4fb920a8961d2309c044395d859041&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737377></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mhartl">mhartl</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737377">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This post raises two issues which everyone keeps conflating. I don't think we can have a productive discussion unless they're kept separate.<p>The first issue is the "you should take notes" mindset. This one is unequivocally wrong. The second issue is the "low cut blouse" remark, which I feel is wrong only by social convention.<p>Here's why the first issue is wrong: It implies that women don't belong in this line of work, that they can't do it effectively, and that they should get out. Factually wrong.<p>The second issue is wrong largely by social convention, I think. It's natural for men and women to be attracted to others in the work place. It's hard to avoid. That said, by social convention we're not supposed to talk about it. Talking about it makes you seem creepy since you're flouting social convention and if you're willing to do that, what else are you willing to do....?<p>However, if the underlying physiological response is not inappropriate (and I don't think it's fair to suggest that it's inappropriate -- it's how we're wired), then how could it be logically inappropriate to mention your feelings? I think our society has found that business proceeds best if we don't mention them and pretend we're not feeling them, but I could envision a culture along the lines of Radical Honesty where just bringing up how you feel isn't wrong.<p>So, keep the issues separate and treat each appropriately. Implying women aren't able to do tech work? Absolutely wrong. Stop it. Indicating that a woman is attractive? Realize it's inappropriate because of how our society determined we should interact at work, not because it's inherently immoral, but still don't do it because it might make her feel uncomfortable.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738064&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3740214 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3740214&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=215356292d0ab18290718f75495978feb0020054&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3740214></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ahoyhere">ahoyhere</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3740214">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>As the woman, I've been the only person in the group asked to put together a pot luck (presumably, this work is beneath the males). I've been the only one asked to take notes in a meeting... even if I'm the one who's presenting (because my title really should be 'secretary who we let on the servers').</i><p>Not saying this is what's happening in these cases, but I've often seen this happen to women not because they're women, but because they create the situation by training people to rely on them to do these things. Women who will take on the tasks nobody else wants to do, who will always do whatever others leave undone, who offers to bring other people food when she goes out, etc. In the spirit of helpfulness or whatever.<p>This happens to men, too, but more women on the whole seem to be the "step in and get it done" type (for whatever reason). The kind you can rely on to bend over backwards to do something when asked, even if it's ridiculous.

However, as a bisexual male, perhaps I have a different perspective than most people here.<p>Fact is, I’ve experienced sexual harassment <i>just as much</i> from women as from men. Who does it, in a given situation, depends only on who’s in power. In the male-dominated tech industry, that means men. But most people like to make sexual comments and advances sometimes, when we feel we can. And, unfortunately, that often make others feel rightly uncomfortable.<p>It’s a sad paradox—one of the best ways to make the industry less hostile to women is to attract more women, to even the power balance.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There is a lot of humor to be had that is both appropriate and not G-rated. Humorous personal stories about awkward situations or odd situations, jokes about things that happened to people on the team (like the time susan brought the server down, or bob's ridiculous obsession with 80s pop), movie references, sexual innuendo (thats what s/he said is usually not sexist), political jokes, topical news jokes, and on and on.<p>I'm so sure you are going to come back with some "blah blah politically correct blah blah" disingenuity, I will adress it now: No, it's not all about PC and rules and whatnot, it's about genuine respect. Making comments and jokes centered on a person which aren't about that person, but about their membership in a class is generally not cool. It's called othering (and sometimes objectification). Othering is exclusionary, and a good joke for the target (but sometimes a good joke to the in-crowd, it solidifies their superiority!). Basically most jokes are OK, if they don't hinge on "and that's why that group is inferior and different from us".</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738512&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738355 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738355&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=eae808c4c3cef0a17b0a7be60bbfd26e72eb31c7&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738355></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=strix_varius">strix_varius</a> 16 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738355">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I would be sad if my relationship with my coworkers couldn't handle, let alone thrive upon, humorous interactions.</i><p>There is a big difference underneath the surface, though on the surface, many such incidents look like just "joking around." The difference has to do with social distance. If you feel an off-color remark is appropriate for someone you barely know, then I hate to tell you, but you're on one end of an asymmetric power relationship, and the other party has the short end of it.<p>It used to be, back in the 50's, men in the US felt entitled to join conversations with and sit at the same table with a pair of young women they didn't know and had just met. That sort of thing is a clear indication of the uneven power relationship. To really understand, you need to be on the "short" end, and more, you need to understand what it's like growing up with that constantly in the environment.<p>Yes, often one doesn't have bad intentions. But I'm explaining it to you now. Just be honest with yourself about social distance and "kidding." If you're really self aware, you may start to realize there's been a difference in social distance between off-color remarks to women vs. others.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I haven't found this in academia as much as in bureaucratic office culture.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>While I agree that leaving the industry might not be the best choice (luckily she did not), we do need to realize that even though this happens in many other industries, IT is one with relatively few women in the first place so think of how lonely it could feel to be singled out and feel like nobody is on your side.<p>Until you feel that, you might empathize, but you can't relate. The easiest way to deal is to think about how you'd want your mother, sister, or spouse to be treated. If you wouldn't like it for them, don't ever stand by and do nothing when this stuff happens. Also, about losing a job or business...if you put a job or a client ahead of your ethics, it's time to do some self refactoring.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736840&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3741266 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3741266&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=b769841b71133abdf9ef347f2c36b865c5d7f6c6&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3741266></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mediacrisis">mediacrisis</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=3741266">link</a></span></div><br>

But the worst part is seeing how many men think we act like an entirely different species, and its disheartening.  Sometimes, comments speak of women as if we don't even read this site.<p>Obviously there are many cultural and sociological norms at play here, but I expect more from this community.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Reading through the article and the comments here it seems to me that there is a tremendous unresolved tension.  There seems to be an idea that we just 'fix the sexism' and that's that.   However, stepping back and asking harder questions makes me think the problems are fundamental to highly developed capitalist economies.  Before you mod  me down, at least read the rest of what I have to say.<p>Everything we do-- what we wear, how we walk, the way we talk, sends subtle social signals, and these impact all areas of life.  Two fundamental (and increasingly entwined) areas of life are sexuality (without which our race dies out) and economic (without which, each of us dies individually).  These are tremendously entertwined, with over half of Americans having dated co-workers (see: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/02/10/the-state-of-the-office-romance-2012/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/02/10/the-state-...</a>).<p>So it seems to me that, particularly single, women navigating the modern workplace are trying to navigate two fundamentally conflicting desires.  The first is to be professional and not be open to the problem of being offered promotions for sexual favors, or retaliation for declining such offers, and the second is to find romance, companionship, love, etc.  The fact that workplace romances are so common cannot be discounted in this area.<p>And so you have two key questions:<p>1)  How do you define appropriate boundaries?  This is a hellishly difficult problem in the context of the workplace.<p>2)  If boundaries aren't bright but involve a lot of give and take, then doesn't that fundamentally mean that there will be a lot of behavior that will fall outside of that which is desirable?<p>I honestly don't see how you solve that problem.<p>On the gender role issue, I am a firm believer that one is generally better off making such tasks as taking notes or arranging potlucks things which are volunteer, and then if that fails, rotated, eliminating those who can't do it reasonably well.<p>But beyond that........  As long as so much of our social spheres surround work, and that's where a lot of opportunity for dating (both for men and women) lies, I just don't buy that you can wish away unwanted attention.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738870&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3739007 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3739007&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=fe72aa08566d0103ce4b3b3d2fe4b2ab98cd3f6f&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3739007></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=natep">natep</a> 10 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3739007">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>And if that co-worker says, "I can't.  I am busy tonight"<p>Does that mean you can't ever ask again?<p>Or if you ask five times and are politely but not definitively turned down can you ask five more times?  25 more times?  Is there no limit?<p>Now we might say there is an obligation to say something definitive.  But then you get into a problem.  What if there is a power difference?  What if you are a general manager of one business unit asking a floor worker in a different business unit out on a date?  Maybe the floor worker is afraid if she hurts your feelings, there will be career consequences?  So does that change things?<p>I don't think sexuality (and that includes romance if we are honest) admits of really simple rules except maybe magic safe words.  These things also thrive on mixed messages.  Magic safe words ("no" and "stop") protect against the worst problems (sexual assault) but not unwanted attention (how am I supposed to definitively know whether the attention is wanted or not?  I can't read minds....), and they don't address the areas where people may want to try to get out of something letting the other person down gently.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739061&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737314 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737314&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=e947810ababd7e66f47df77013c42943b03dfd55&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737314></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jiggy2011">jiggy2011</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737314">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"That's such a come-hither watch".<p>Making objectifying comments in the workplace is wrong, no two ways about it.  But because I don't have your context, this one jumped out at me as "could be interpreted in many ways".  I'm curious if I can cajole a bit more context out of you? (because I've made my share of innocently-intended comments resulting in a situation going horribly awry, so I'm always looking to improve my appropriateness radar).<p>Specifically, do you think it was A) an innocent/clueless comment, B) a "testing the waters" comment as a prelude to hitting on you, or C) outright hitting on you?<p>A) Do you think he was just complimenting you on the watch?  Particularly, I wonder because he made the comment about a thing, not about you.  I.e., consider the difference between "that's a sexy skirt" and "you have a sexy ass".  The later is clearly objectifying, but the former could be interpreted innocently or offensively, because its a comment about an object (although even the former is pretty risky -- you'd have to be very close friends with the person and be sure they'd understand your intent to feel safe making such a remark).<p>B) Or perhaps he was "testing the waters"?  I've notice that being labelled a "creep" actually has more to do with whether your attraction is unrequited, than whether the action was objectively creepy, and a "testing the waters" approach is one way to try and avoid being the office creepster.  Unless of course even testing the waters is creepster material (I hope not...).<p>C) or was he just flat-out being a slime ball?</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738193&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737889 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737889&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=8b40c797009e89db90554b428dbb1b166acdab03&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737889></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aptsurdist">aptsurdist</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737889">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>My £0.02: having worked in a few teams in the UK, France and Sweden over the course of the last decade, I'd say this is a cultural effect that can be won over locally by a certain company or social group, but would require a coordinated and concerted effort on behalf of men and women to stamp this kind of stealth-bullying out of social acceptability. I fully support the men who will help call out this kind of behaviour, and am also fully satisfied that this issue has front-paged HN for as long as it has.<p>From my own experience of work, cultural norms and popular issues, although only the smallest of samples, I'd say that (younger) Swedes have a much better handle on the balance of respect and gender roles than their peers in FR or the UK (England, specifically). Even the most subtle attempt at sexism is picked up on to a degree where it is unacceptable to at least publicly chance a remark of this kind in the workplace or in the media. Why this is I can only guess.<p>Prevalent (older) attitudes may account for the continued pay discrepancy between men and women and all that this reflects, but I'd say the Swedes have a very much less subtly-offensive 'working atmosphere' than those I've been part of elsewhere.<p>Also troubling is the question of 'women/babies/employment', but that's a whole other can of worms; just as a parting shot - men also leave poorly managed jobs when something better in life is offered to them, at least you get up to 9 months warning with women.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3739145&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738944 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738944&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=d1b9e753c762d03dd711031f98927a95e79b3af3&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738944></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=paganel">paganel</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738944">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Would you enjoy working with this author, regardless of gender?<p>I work on a small team - just over 20 people - with only four women.<p>Every single one is a hilarious, self-possessed, confident individual. All the men, myself included, treat them with respect... meaning, we tease the shit out of them.<p>To do otherwise would exclude them from the team. Have you ever seen a cohesive group that didn't joke around? A tiny fraction of the jabs traded by men are HR-approved... if we filtered that for the women who work with us, we would be treating them as if they're too weak or too sensitive to be a part of the group.<p>So instead, we treat them no differently than any other team member. If one of the other coders were to arrive unusually dressed up, I would absolutely comment on it, regardless of whether it's a suit or a dress, but one of the ladies would probably beat me to it. Frankly, the women push the HR line harder than any of us guys, and we love them for it.<p>If you find that people are consistently telling you to "lighten up," whether you're male or female, you shouldn't assume that the world is conspiring to put you down. You're probably just no fun to work with.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738315&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738196 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738196&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=9c875818f04b00fdccdd74e5e60c6969822f2265&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738196></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=didip">didip</a> 16 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738196">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Cass R. Sunstein in <i>Free Markets and Social Justice</i> offers a chapter with an interesting perspective called "Why Markets Don't Stop Discrimination." The book is actually one of the more readable economics works I've seen, and the author gives a more in-depth account of why competitive markets would normally be believed to work the way you're saying you expect them to work.<p>The basic idea is that even if you operate in a competitive market, your customers and associates may not: and due to this, competitive markets can sometimes only float the ball to some socially-appropriate level. So, let's talk about someone who stops doing business with you because they know your programmers are female and they hold some subconscious belief that female code is of lower quality. (I mean, if you called them on it they would say "no, of course not!" but somewhere deep inside they'd prefer the familiar and they discriminate institutionally rather than individually.) Now your incentives to discriminate are bound up in a complex: that complex contains <i>their tastes</i>, and what they're willing to pay to get a product which tastes right to them. If they're in a very competitive market they might not be able to afford <i>any</i> overhead, but if they're a personal user, or they are turning a profit, they get to choose based on their tastes alone and then your financial incentive is to also institutionally discriminate. The whole point is that discrimination might be "economically rational" while nondiscrimination might be "social justice" and therefore they can come at odds -- which is more or less the topic of the book.<p>I found it an interesting idea.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737339&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737922 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737922&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=311cb8851fa3c4bc591df1589f36ee94e658d456&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737922></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Alex3917">Alex3917</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737922">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's a real problem here that comes down to the status-quo of the office. Imagine your office of 100 people is 50% male/female, and a nice sampling of racial groups, sexualities and ages (I've had the fortune to work in such a place). What happens is that there is sufficient diversity <i>and</i> commonality between enough people of their varying interests, looks and views, that you find it completely unnecessary to make comments about what someone is wearing, or whether their gender deems them capable. I say again, the problem with the high-tech industry is there is simply not enough diversity. Now we can't fix this today or tomorrow, maybe not in 10 years, but you can certainly imagine that it's there. With any comment, consider what is appropriate given a hypothetical situation where there is a good balance of whatever-stereotype-you-are-addressing and go from there.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738066&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738153 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738153&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=4d9c5c6e083a0715dc68654e910350fb8b3e4992&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738153></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jimmyjazz14">jimmyjazz14</a> 17 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738153">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I like to joke around and have a good time while doing serious work. This isnt some profound optimization technique, just something that makes my day happier and usually that of those around me. However, my general rule of thumb is to never directly engage a female at the workplace outside of a purely professional, subdued necessity. They are too sensitive. While I know I have good intentions and care for their happiness, not everyone has the same level of empathy. So I simply avoid getting grouped into the fratboy category even when I really do want them to just lighten up a bit. I personally find blanket invitations to after-work drinks to be a better environment to get more friendly with the ladies on the team, most will drop their shields a few notches.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3736887&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3736953 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3736953&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=f226c2a9d2aff7f7fe0073adb8d792d368fe8e08&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3736953></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jamesaguilar">jamesaguilar</a> 22 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3736953">link</a></span></div><br>

The folks in my office have very casual and friendly relationships and we often find ourselves discussing, and joking about, very sensitive topics, the women included.<p>The issue is not that women are too sensitive to joke with or talk with about these things.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with these posts is that we only hear the horror stories. We get a sensational picture of constant harassment from one unlucky person. Most of what was written here was outright harassment. In many places it would be seen as outright illegal for the company to allow this to continue.<p>I take issue with complaining about "subtle" sexism, however. Life is not fair for men either. In fact, unfairness is universal in life for reasons that are out of anybody's control. By pushing for unobtainable fairness, you are training people to expect fairness, which is disabling. Boys are attacked by other boys in school. You are constantly tested by other males for signs of fear. Big deal. It toughens you up for later life. Gender "equality" in many ways has become just another production output to be maximised without regard to secondary costs.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737127&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737267 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737267&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=388a87b9b990509d71d086494561e5b952043315&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737267></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=antiterra">antiterra</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737267">link</a></span></div><br>

Whatever 'female privilege' you can try to conjure up in general is largely irrelevant to this very specific setting: a technology profession.

Is it really that unobtainable to not make jokes about PMS or breasts?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Because of your plea for civil discussion, I mistakenly assumed that you would interpret my words in good faith (and, for the record, I <i>can't</i> downvote.) Instead, I suppose I should have qualified the hypothetical punches as just sufficient in force to cause pain and irritation but not enough to exacerbate health issues. I'm really not sure what the flu has to do with anything, facial contusions are quite a different thing than a systemic infection.<p>The point still stands, that small issues matter even when there are bigger issues.<p>You have given nothing to support the argument that treating someone as subservient based on gender 'ultimately does us good.'<p>Toughening (or lightening) up is a good thing. I was bullied in school to a distressing degree. Later in my life, I went through training where I learned to shrug off hits far worse than any bully had given me. Sometimes they were accidental and I laughed about it.<p>However, that doesn't mean it's ok for someone to just walk up to me and sock me in the face. It doesn't mean that it's ok to attack people and just demand that they toughen up and deal with it.<p>By your argument we should all treat each other like complete crap at home and at work, because it will build character like a lifelong boot camp. Heck, maybe we should treat women <i>specifically</i> like crap so they can get more resilient and perform better than men.<p>Of course, another poster claims that computer programmers are awkward around women and have such bad self-esteem they should be forgiven. I wonder how well <i>they</i> would fare if the tables were turned.<p>Honestly, it sounds like an argument born out of the desire to not give up being a jerk to women. It sounds like "lighten up," for no real reason.

Quote me where I said this, or I will be forced to regard you as a liar.<p>And I never said "small issues don't matter". Why make things up? I am saying that I am bored with endless complaints that exist around noise level. Since I posted a few times and I may not have been redundant enough, I'll be explicit in that I think taunting women about their breasts in the workplace is despicable and anyone who witnessed such a thing should immediately speak up. Anything less is cowardice.<p>My beef with this post is the complaints about "subtle" sexism. People don't seem to understand that people are unfair to others all the time. There is nothing but a kind of blind secular faith that eliminating these micro-injustices is going to help anybody. So you show me someone who refuses to hire women or abuses them and I will tell them where to stick it. I stand up to people who promote ideas I think are harmful. But I don't want to hear about "perceived" problems that are indistinguishable from the noise-level unfairness that nobody can stop ("boohoo I got asked to take some notes and I think it _might_ have been because I am a woman"). If you don't want to take notes say "no". Better yet do a shitty job. Instead we have people arguing about how one type of slave gets whipped on the buttocks and the other gets it on the thigh, missing the point that if we set the slaves free they wouldn't be getting whipped at all.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thank you for your clarifications. I'm glad we've been able to get past the quibbles.<p>I don't think smaller issues should be ignored. Continuing my metaphor, I don't think the flu should be ignored. It is a health problem that must be addressed. But for most healthy individuals it is properly addressed by sleep, fluids and relaxation. Sometimes people get it badly and theuy need further treatment. But by stuffing everyone with antibiotics to prevent the mere possibility of pneumonia or even bronchitis, we are causing secondary problems such as antibiotic resistance. Similarly, whenever we try to over-think human interaction we grow the beast of rationalistic meddling.<p>Trying to eliminate the flu would be foolish. Stuffing people with antibiotics is foolish. I am not making a dogmatic statement about how all small problems are irrelevant. I am expressing frustration with more complaints over increasingly marginal grievances. It points to a lack of character and a mindless quest to maximise some sense of fairness that for me often lacks authenticity. If we become touchy about small issues we will lose all resilience and perspective.<p>Leaving aside despicable comments about breasts and so forth that we can easily address through instant reprimand, I don't think being asked to do the notes in a meeting or organise a potluck represents subservience. It is just as stupid as complaining about a request for "a few strong men" to help move some things. Or the stupid outrages over "mrs" versus "ms". People are so sensitive. Raise your objection or get on with it.<p>I'm not saying the poster is a bad person here. I don't think it's wrong to make this post. Nor would I think it's wrong for someone to complain about any number of other trivial things. But it does point to a sense of entitlement and lack of resilience. I don't like that, and I think we should be working against that trend, not with it.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738214&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737382 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737382&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=67578c33f3f6caf7c391bbb3388dba2f7241a94c&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737382></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=javascriptlol">javascriptlol</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737382">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If you walk around alone in an unsafe neighborhood at night, you're asking for trouble. If you don't have a choice but to be in an unsafe neighborhood, hunker down and get to a point in your life when you can afford a safe neighborhood.<p>In the programming world, this translates to : become a great programmer, and you will find yourself in a great programming environment (birds of a feather...). If you really love programming, you will get to that point eventually.<p>Great programmers love programming, and love learning from other great programmers even more. That's why they'll never offend another great programmer or risk it all by indulging in bad behavior. (You can actually substitute "great programmer" here with "great any-profession". There might be exceptions, but in 15 years of programming, I haven't met any.)<p>When you don't have these types of programmers around you, whats left is the (sub-)average programmer, and the concomitant sexist environment.<p>Also, by wearing a low-cut blouse to a professional environment, you drive away those people who actually contribute to a good environment, leaving behind those that don't.<p>Biologically, men's brains light up when they see a woman's cleavage. The people who value you as a programmer will avoid you, because they recognize what's going on in their heads, avoid the distraction, and the risk of offending you. Heck, some of them might not even look in your direction. My advice is the same one I give my daughters: wear a scarf - it prevents the over-heating problem you mentioned. Its the same reason I wear boxers, rather than walk around in shorts.<p>You don't need to lighten up, just hunker down.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738004&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3738980 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3738980&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=26f453cd52bd75f8447c7510803c5eece79d3c14&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3738980></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=natep">natep</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3738980">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think that solving the problem of an unsafe neighborhood is much more intractable than solving sexism in the workplace. Mostly, this is because 'we' are not part of the culture in those unsafe neighborhoods. We are part of the tech culture. If we, as a culture/society/whatever can agree that this kind of behavior is unethical, unprofessional, and not welcome, then we can and should express our disapproval towards those who are sexist, or allow for sexism to be the problem it is.<p>So, to me, you're saying that because we can't solve unsafe neighborhoods by calling out that undesirable behavior when we see it (which we can't), we shouldn't call out undesirable behavior in an unsafe work environment.<p>Biologically, human minds do or want to do lots of things when presented with various stimuli. That doesn't mean it's OK for them to do it. I wonder if we're biologically inclined to victim-blame the way you just did...</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738980&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3741519 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3741519&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=678825099bc7b6b8b85eef21a0871a4fc6013ec2&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3741519></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mattacular">mattacular</a> 37 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=3741519">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#888888>At my work place we throw around homoerotic jokes and comments all the time and no one is offended. I guess it is only if you're comfortable enough with a group that you can ask them to do ridiculous things, kind of funny way. In rework it mentions that you should hire friends, sounds like that girl is the stranger wether it is because she is a girl or wether the men are disgusting pigs - whatever the case.<p>She can adapt the group become a leader, I've seen it happen with girls or she can cry about being an abused minority. Such is a difference between strong and weak people. Granted we don't come to work to be leaders some of us enjoy just writing code and doodling up layouts and logos in photoshop. In this case a compromise should be found - offsite work on the project. From a coffee shop or otherwise. You know there are other companies to work with as well, maybe with better female/male ratio.<p>In the end this is a battle of sexes, the chemistry is wrong - men want to have sex with women and when you add in the mix work and being close, you can either make so that you are not attractive to any of the male members of the work force or do something else. Asking men not to be men is just as cruel as asking a woman to be a man. One way to augment this issue is to hire a ton of girls to work in the team to maybe dilute the male collective. But in every case this may lead to different and unpredictable results. You can't just board a pirate ship and expect sailors to behave all gentlemanly at once -  maybe pirate ship full of amazons? at any rate this is hugely complicated because people are. Complaining about it won't get you anywhere, acting does.<p>Most of us want to see more females in the force. Most of the time nerds I know work harder, because they want to strut their awesome code and how well it works before female member of the team.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3738986&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=14></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"></span></div><span class="comment">[deleted]</span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3736644 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3736644&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=7ed2aebf46991c8b7c1b4a7035ef3b15c1e84312&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3736644></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=logjam">logjam</a> 23 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3736644">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; No, the real reason I'm "white-knighting" is because I think it's shitty to make people feel uncomfortable for who they are.<p>I don't think you get it.  Your "white-knighting" on the internet does so little for the cause you're claiming to be fighting for that it begs the assumption of an ulterior motive.  That motive does not have to be "getting sexual favors."  It can also be, hey, looking really great and noble and pure to your peers!  That's been valuable since the dawn of society.<p>The best part about all the white-knighting that's happening in this thread is how many people are being zealously villainized for their rational responses.  It's absolutely delusional how <i>far</i> words are being stretched and twisted to shove someone over to the side of "the problem"  <i>including</i> your twisting of what "white-knighting" is to not-so-indirectly implicate me as a "sexist asshole."

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You can't have it both ways.<p>You're favoring the opinion of one sex over another because of their experiences.

But it's the same thing you're trying to pull right now.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737740&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=480></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3737831 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=3737831&dir=up&by=grammati&auth=b88ef579c4bd55d40d4a89ca7ac21a7d52a892da&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3737831></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hythloday">hythloday</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3737831">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But "leadership and conflict" aren't natural, essential experiences of being a man. I'm asserting that sexist put-downs <i>are</i> a natural and essential part of being a woman.<p>If you must have a male corollary, I think there's a case to be made that men suffer from success anxiety--that their self-worth is tied to material success--much more than women (I'm not saying this is "female privilege" or "sexism against men", just that it's something that men are evaluated on much more intensely than women). Would I favour a man's view of male success anxiety over a woman's? Yes, probably.<p>But things like "leadership" or "conflict" are at best loosely correlated with gender--that doesn't make men automatically experts on it any more than it makes all men CEOs or heads of state just because the majority of those positions are filled by men.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3737831&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%37%33%36%30%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><br>
